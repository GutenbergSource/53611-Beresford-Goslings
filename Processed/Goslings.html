<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Gosling. He leaned against the dresser; the
kitchen was hot with steam, and he fumbled for a handkerchief in the
pocket of his black tail coat. He produced first a large red bandanna
with which he blew his nose vigorously. &ldquo;Snuff
&rsquo;andkerchief; brought it &rsquo;ome to be washed,&rdquo; he
remarked, and then brought out a white handkerchief which he used to
wipe his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dirty &rsquo;abit snuff-taking,&rdquo; commented
Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t smoke in the orfice,&rdquo; replied
Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;, I suppose?&rdquo; said
his wife.</p>
<p>When the recital of this formula had been accomplished&mdash;it was
hallowed by a precise repetition every week, and had been established
now for a quarter of a century&mdash;Gosling returned to the subject in
hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They does a lot of lookin&rsquo; at shops,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and then nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;ll satisfy &rsquo;em but
buyin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;. Why don&rsquo;t they keep away from
&rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well; sales begin nex&rsquo; week,&rdquo; replied Mrs
Gosling. &ldquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a thing we &rsquo;ave to
consider in our circumstances.&rdquo; She left the vicinity of the
gas-stove, and bustled over to the dresser. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, get out
of my way, do,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;an&rsquo; go up and change
your coat. Dinner&rsquo;ll be ready in two ticks. I shan&rsquo;t wait
for the gells if they ain&rsquo;t in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them sales is a fraud,&rdquo; remarked Gosling, but he did
not stop to argue the point.</p>
<p>He went upstairs and changed his respectable &ldquo;morning&rdquo;
coat for a short alpaca jacket, slipped his cuffs over his hands, put
one inside the other and placed them in their customary position on the
chest of drawers, changed his boots for carpet slippers, wetted his
hair brush and carefully plastered down a long wisp of grey hair over
the top of his bald head, and then went into the bathroom to wash his
hands.</p>
<p>There had been a time in George Gosling&rsquo;s history when he had
not been so regardful of the decencies of life. But he was a man of
position now, and his two daughters insisted on these ceremonial
observances.</p>
<p>Gosling was one of the world&rsquo;s successes. He had started life
as a National School boy, and had worked his way up through all the
grades&mdash;messenger, office-boy, junior clerk, clerk, senior clerk,
head clerk, accountant&mdash;to his present responsible position as
head of the counting-house, with a salary of &pound;26 a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>month. He
rented a house in Wisteria Grove, Brondesbury, at &pound;45 a year; he
was a sidesman of the church of St John the Evangelist, Kilburn; a
member of Local Committees; and in moments of expansion he talked of
seeking election to the District Council. A solid, sober, thoroughly
respectable man, Gosling, about whom there had never been a hint of
scandal; grown stout now, and bald&mdash;save for a little hair over
the ears, and that one persistent grey tress which he used as a sort of
insufficient wrapping for his naked skull.</p>
<p>Such was the George Gosling seen by his wife, daughters, neighbours,
and heads of the firm of wholesale provision merchants for whom he had
worked for forty-one years in Barbican, E.C. Yet there was another man,
hardly realized by George Gosling himself, and apparently so little
representative that even his particular cronies in the office would
never have entered any description of him, if they had been obliged to
give a detailed account of their colleague&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you heard Gosling laughing uproariously at some
story produced by one of those cronies, you might be quite certain that
it was a story he would not repeat before his daughters, though he
might tell his wife&mdash;if it were not too broad. If you watched
Gosling in the street, you would see that he took a strange,
unaccountable interest in the feet and ankles of young women. And if
many of Gosling&rsquo;s thoughts and desires had been translated into
action, the Vicar of St John the Evangelist would have dismissed his
sidesman with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>disgust, the Local Committees would have had no more
of him, and his wife and daughters would have regarded him as the most
depraved of criminals.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Gosling had never been tempted beyond the powers of his
resistance. At fifty-five, he may be regarded as safe from temptation.
He seldom put any restraint upon his thoughts, outside business hours;
but he had an ideal which ruled his life&mdash;the ideal of
respectability. George Gosling counted himself&mdash;and others counted
him also&mdash;as respectable a man as could be found in the
Metropolitan Police area. There were, perhaps, a quarter of a million
other men in the same area, equally respectable.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As he was drying his hands, Gosling heard the front
door slam and his daughters&rsquo; voices in the passage below,
followed by a shrill exhortation from the kitchen: &ldquo;Now, gels,
&rsquo;urry up, dinner&rsquo;s all ready and your father&rsquo;s
waitin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling trotted downstairs and received the usual salute from his
two girls. He noted that they were a shade more effusive than usual.
&ldquo;Want more money for fal-lals,&rdquo; was his inward comment.
They were always wanting money for &ldquo;fal-lals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He adopted his usual line of defence through dinner and constantly
brought the subject of conversation back to the need for a reduction of
expenses. He did not see Blanche wink at Millie across the table,
during these strategic exercises; nor catch the glance of understanding
which passed between <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7"
name="pb7">7</a>]</span>the girls and their mother. So, as his dinner
comforted and cheered him, Gosling began to relax into his usual
facetiousness; incredibly believing, despite the invariable precedents
of his family history, that his daughters had been convinced of the
hopelessness of approaching him for money that evening.</p>
<p>The credulous creature even allowed them to make their opening, and
then assisted them to a statement of their petition.</p>
<p>They were talking of a friend&rsquo;s engagement to be married, and
Gosling with an obtuseness he never displayed in business remarked,
&ldquo;Wish my gels &rsquo;ud get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about us, father?&rdquo; asked Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the only gels I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;as I
know of,&rdquo; said Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how can you expect us to get married when we
haven&rsquo;t got a decent thing to put on?&rdquo; returned
Blanche.</p>
<p>Gosling realized his danger too late. &ldquo;Pooh! That don&rsquo;t
make any difference,&rdquo; he said hastily, adopting a thoroughly
unsound line of defence; &ldquo;I never noticed what your mother was
wearing when I courted &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dessay you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Millie, &ldquo;I
dessay most fellows couldn&rsquo;t tell you what a girl was wearing,
but it makes just all the difference for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it does,&rdquo; said Blanche. &ldquo;A girl&rsquo;s
got no chance these days unless she can look smart. No fellow&rsquo;s
going to marry a dowdy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does make a big difference, there&rsquo;s no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>denyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; put in Mrs Gosling, as though
she was being convinced against her will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the sales are just beginning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Gosling knew the game was up. They had made no direct attack
upon his pocket, yet; but they would not relax their grip of this
fascinating subject till they had achieved their object. Blanche was
saying that she was ashamed to be seen anywhere; and procrastination
would be met at once by the argument&mdash;how well he knew
it&mdash;based on the premise that if you didn&rsquo;t buy at
sale-time, you had to pay twice as much later.</p>
<p>It was quite useless for Gosling to fidget, throw himself back in
his chair, frown, shake his head, and look horribly determined; the
course of progress was unalterable from the direct attack: &ldquo;Do
you <i>like</i> to see us going about in rags, father?&rdquo; through
the stage of &ldquo;Well, well, &rsquo;ow much do you want? I simply
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> afford&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and the ensuing haggles
down to the despairing sigh as the original minimum demanded&mdash;in
this case no less than five pounds&mdash;was forlornly conceded, and
clinched by Blanche&rsquo;s, &ldquo;We must have it before the end of
the week, dad, the sales begin on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of it all, he received what compensation they had to
offer him; hugs and kisses, offers to do all sorts of impossible
things, assistance in getting his armchair into precisely the right
position, and him into the chair, and the table cleared and the lamp in
just the right place for him to read his half-penny evening paper which
was fetched for him from the pocket of his overcoat. And, finally, the
crux of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>Gosling&rsquo;s whole position, a general air of
complacency, good-temper and comfort.</p>
<p>Gosling was an easy-going man, he hated rows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, you two,&rdquo; he remarked with a return to
facetiousness as he settled himself with his carpet slippers spread out
to the fire&mdash;&ldquo;mind you, I look on this money as an
investment. You two gels got to get married; and quick or I shall be in
the bankrup&rsquo;cy Court. Don&rsquo;t you forget as these
&lsquo;fal-lals&rsquo; is bought for a purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so horrid, father,&rdquo; said Blanche,
with a change of front; &ldquo;it sounds as if we were setting traps
for men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Gosling. &ldquo;You said
just now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like that,&rdquo; interrupted Blanche. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
very different just wanting to look nice. Personally, I&rsquo;m in no
&rsquo;urry to get married, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait till Mr Right comes along,&rdquo; put in Mrs
Gosling, and then turned the conversation by saying: &ldquo;Well,
father, what&rsquo;s the news this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; excitin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Gosling.
&ldquo;Seems this new plague&rsquo;s spreadin&rsquo; in
China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re always inventin&rsquo; new diseases, nowadays,
or callin&rsquo; old ones by new names,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling. The
two girls were busy with a sheet of note-paper and a stump of pencil
that seemed to require frequent lubrication; they were making
calculations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s quite new, seemingly,&rdquo; returned
Gosling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the men as get it.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No need for us to worry, then,&rdquo; put in Millie, more as
a duty, some slight return for benefits promised, than because she took
any interest in the subject. Blanche was absorbed; her unseeing gaze
was fixed on the mantelpiece and ever and again she removed the point
of the pencil from her mouth and wrote feverishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; replied Gosling. He turned his
head in order to argue from so strong a position. &ldquo;And
where&rsquo;d you be, and all the rest of the women, if you
&rsquo;adn&rsquo;t got no men to look after you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect we could get along pretty well, if we had to,&rdquo;
said Millie.</p>
<p>Gosling winked at his wife, and indicated by an upward movement of
his chin that he was astounded at such innocence. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d
buy your &lsquo;fal-lals&rsquo; for you, I should like to know?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to earn money for ourselves,&rdquo; said
Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;d like to see you or Blanche takin&rsquo; over my
job,&rdquo; replied her father. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll lay
there&rsquo;s &rsquo;alf a dozen mistakes in the figurin&rsquo;
she&rsquo;s doing at the present moment. Let me see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche descended suddenly from visions of Paradise, and put her
hand over the sheet of note-paper. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,
father,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Gosling looked sly. &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; he said, with simulated
surprise. &ldquo;And why not?<a id="xd26e334" name="xd26e334"></a>
Ain&rsquo;t I to be allowed to judge of the nature of the investment
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; in for? I might give you an &rsquo;int or two
from the gentleman&rsquo;s point of view.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>Blanche shook her head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t added it up
yet,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Gosling did not press the point; he returned to his original
position. &ldquo;I dunno where you ladies &rsquo;ud be if you
&rsquo;adn&rsquo;t no gentlemen to look after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling smirked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ope it won&rsquo;t
come to that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s a long way
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appears as there&rsquo;s been one case in Russia,
though,&rdquo; remarked Gosling. He saw that he had rather a good thing
in this threat of male extermination, a pleasant, harmless threat to
hold over his feminine dependents; a means to emphasize the facts of
masculine superiority and of the absolute necessity for masculine
intelligence; facts that were not sufficiently well realized in
Wisteria Grove, at times.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling yawned surreptitiously. She was doing her best to be
pleasant, but the subject bored her. She was a practical woman who
worked hard all day to keep her house clean, and received very feeble
assistance from the daughters for whom her one ambition was an
establishment conducted on lines precisely similar to her own.</p>
<p>Millie and Blanche had returned to their calculations and were
completely absorbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Russia? Just fancy,&rdquo; commented Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Moscow,&rdquo; said Gosling, studying his <i>Evening
News</i>. &ldquo;&rsquo;E was an official on the trans-Siberian
Railway. &lsquo;As soon as the disease was identified as a case of the
new plague,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; read Gosling, &ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;the
patient was at once removed to the infectious hospital and strictly
isolated. He died within two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>hours of his admission. Stringent
measures are being taken to prevent the infection from
spreading.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was &rsquo;e a married man?&rdquo; asked Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; replied her husband. &ldquo;But the
point is that if it once gets to Europe, who knows where it&rsquo;ll
stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see to that, you may be sure,&rdquo; said Mrs
Gosling, with a beautiful faith in the scientific resources of
civilization. &ldquo;It said somethin&rsquo; about that in the bit
you&rsquo;ve just read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling was not to be done out of his argument. &ldquo;Very
like,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But now, just supposin&rsquo; as this
&rsquo;ere plague did spread to London, and &rsquo;alf the men
couldn&rsquo;t go to work; where d&rsquo;you fancy you&rsquo;d
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling was unable to grasp the intricacies of this abstraction.
&ldquo;Well, of course, every one knows as we couldn&rsquo;t get on
without the men,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! well there you are, got it in once,&rdquo; said Gosling.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you gels forget it,&rdquo; he added turning to
his daughters.</p>
<p>Millie only giggled, but Blanche said, &ldquo;All right, dad, we
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls returned to their calculations; they had arrived at the
stage of cutting out all those items which were not &ldquo;absolutely
necessary.&rdquo; Five pounds had proved a miserably inadequate sum on
paper.</p>
<p>Gosling returned to his <i>Evening News</i>, which presently slipped
gently from his hand to the floor. Mrs Gosling looked up from her
sewing and put a finger on her lips. The voices of Blanche and Millie
were subdued to sibilant whisperings. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>Gosling had forgotten his economic problems, and his daring
abstractions concerning a world despoiled of male activity, especially
of that essential activity, as he figured it, the making of
money&mdash;the wage-earner was enjoying his after-dinner nap, hedged
about, protected and cared for by his womankind.</p>
<p>There may have been a quarter of a million wage-earners in Greater
London at that moment, who, however much they differed from Gosling on
such minor questions as Tariff Reform or the capabilities of the then
Chancellor of the Exchequer, would have agreed with him as a matter of
course, on the essentials he had discussed that evening.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At half-past nine the click of the letter-box,
followed by a resounding double-knock, announced the arrival of the
last post. Millie jumped up at once and went out eagerly.</p>
<p>Mr Gosling opened his eyes and stared with drunken fixity at the
mantelpiece; then, without moving the rest of his body, he began to
grope automatically with his left hand for the fallen newspaper. He
found it at last, picked it up and pretended to read with sleep-sodden
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the post, dear,&rdquo; remarked Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>Gosling yawned enormously. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millie! Millie!&rdquo; called Mrs Gosling. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you bring the letters in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie did not reply, but she came slowly into the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>room, in
her hands a letter which she was examining minutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s it for, Mill?&rdquo; asked Blanche,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; replied Millie, still intent on her study.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a foreign letter. I seem to remember the writing,
too, only I can&rsquo;t fix it exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;and it over, my gel,&rdquo; said Gosling,
and Millie reluctantly parted with her fascinating enigma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that &rsquo;and, too,&rdquo; remarked Gosling, and he,
also, would have spent some time in the attempt to guess the puzzle
without looking up the answer within the envelope, but the three
spectators, who were not sharing his interest, manifested
impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t you going to open it, father?&rdquo; asked
Millie, and Mrs Gosling looked at her husband over her spectacles and
remarked, &ldquo;It must be a business letter, if it comes from foreign
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get business letters to this address,&rdquo;
returned the head of the house, &ldquo;besides which it&rsquo;s from
Warsaw; we don&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; with Warsaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he opened the letter.</p>
<p>The three women fixed their gaze on Gosling&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; ejaculated Millie, after a silence of several
seconds. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never guess,&rdquo; said Gosling
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone we know?&rdquo; asked Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! tell us, father,&rdquo; urged the impatient Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the Mr Thrale, as lodged with us once,&rdquo;
announced Gosling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"
name="pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! dear, our Mr Fastidious,&rdquo; commented Blanche,
&ldquo;I thought he was dead long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be over four years since &rsquo;e left,&rdquo; put in
Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting on for five,&rdquo; corrected Blanche. &ldquo;I
remember I put my hair up while he was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he say?&rdquo; asked Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E says, &lsquo;Dear Mr Gosling, I expect you will be
surprised to &rsquo;ear from me after my five years&rsquo;
silence&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said it was five years,&rdquo; put in Blanche. &ldquo;Go
on, dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad resumed &ldquo;&hellip; &lsquo;but I &rsquo;ave been in various
parts of the world and it &rsquo;as been quite impossible to keep up a
correspondence. I am writing now to tell you that I shall be back in
London in a few days, and to ask you whether you can find a room for me
in Wisteria Grove?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! I should &rsquo;ave thought he&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave
written to me to ask that!&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So &rsquo;e should &rsquo;ave, by rights,&rdquo; agreed
Gosling. &ldquo;But &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a queer card is Mr
Thrale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit dotty, if you ask me,&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S that all?&rdquo; asked Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;e says: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give you an address
as I go on to Berlin immediately, but I will look you up the evening
after I arrive. Eastern Europe is not safe at the present time. There
&rsquo;ave been several cases of the new plague in Moscow, but the
authorities are doing everything they can&mdash;which is much in
Russia&mdash;to keep the news out of the press, yours sincerely,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>Jasper Thrale,<span class="corr" id="xd26e459"
title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> and that&rsquo;s the lot,&rdquo;
concluded Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think he&rsquo;s a cool hand,&rdquo; commented Blanche.
&ldquo;Of course you won&rsquo;t have him as a paying guest
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling and his wife looked at each other, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E might bring the infection,&rdquo; suggested Mrs
Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no fear of that,&rdquo; returned her husband, &ldquo;but
I dunno as we want a boarder now. Five years ago I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t
got my big rise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, father; what would the neighbours think of us if we
started to take boarders again?&rdquo; protested Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t look well,&rdquo; agreed Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; what I was thinking,&rdquo; said the head of the
house. &ldquo;&rsquo;Owever, there&rsquo;s no &rsquo;arm in
payin&rsquo; us a friendly visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course not,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling, &ldquo;though I
do think it odd &rsquo;e shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave written to me in
the first place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dotty!&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>Gosling shook his head. &ldquo;Not by a very long chalk &rsquo;e
ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was his firm pronouncement&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, girls, what about bed?&rdquo; asked Mrs Gosling,
putting away the &ldquo;bit of mending&rdquo; she had been engaged
upon.</p>
<p>Gosling yawned again, stretched himself, and rose grunting to his
feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about ready for <i>my</i> bed,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>he remarked, and after another yawn he started his
nightly round of inspection.</p>
<p>When he returned to the sitting-room the others were all ready to
retire. Gosling kissed his daughters, and the two girls and their
mother went upstairs. Gosling carefully took off the larger pieces of
coal from the fire and put them under the grate, rolled up the
hearthrug, saw that the window was securely fastened, extinguished the
lamp and followed his &ldquo;womenfolk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was undressing his thoughts turned once more to the threat of
the new disease which was devastating China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum thing about that new plague,&rdquo; he remarked to his
wife. &ldquo;Seems as it&rsquo;s only men as get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d never let it spread to England,&rdquo; replied
Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there&rsquo;s no fear of that, none whatever,&rdquo; said
Gosling, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s rum that about women never catching
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attitude of the Goslings faithfully reflected that of the
immense majority of English people. The faith in the hygienic and
scientific resources which were at the disposal of the authorities, and
the implicit trust in the vigilance and energy of those authorities,
were sufficient to allay any fears that were not too imminent. It was
some one&rsquo;s duty to look after these things, and if they were not
looked after there would be letters in the papers about it. At last,
without question, the authorities would be roused to a sense of duty
and the trouble, whatever it was, would be stopped. Precisely what
authority <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>managed these affairs none of the huge Gosling
family knew. Vaguely they pictured Medical Boards, or Health
Committees; dimly they connected these things with local government; at
the top, doubtless, was some managing authority&mdash;in Whitehall
probably&mdash;something to do with the supreme head of affairs, the
much abused but eminently paternal Government. <span class=

Gurney.</p>
<p>Jasper Thrale sat forward in his chair. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t do what I&rsquo;ve done&mdash;and
more,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theoretically, I suppose not,&rdquo; replied Gurney.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just making the big effort to start with. You see
I&rsquo;ve got a very decent berth and good prospects, and it&rsquo;s
comfortable and all that. Only when some fellow like you comes along
and tells one yarns of the world outside, I get sort of hankerings
after the sea and adventure, and seeing the big things. It&rsquo;s only
now and then&mdash;ordinary times I&rsquo;m contented enough.&rdquo; He
stuck his pipe in the corner of his mouth and stared into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only things that really count are feeling clean and
strong and able,&rdquo; said Thrale. &ldquo;You never really have that
feeling if you live in the big cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt like that sometimes after a long bicycle
ride,&rdquo; interpolated Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then the feeling is wasted, you see,&rdquo; said Thrale.
&ldquo;When you feel like that and there is something tremendous to
spend it upon, you get the great emotion as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the glimmer of St Agnes&rsquo; light, after you&rsquo;d
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>been eight weeks out of sight of land?&rdquo;
reflected Gurney, going back to one of Thrale&rsquo;s
reminiscences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To feel that you are a part of life, not this dead, stale
life of the city, but the life of the whole universe,&rdquo; said
Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied Gurney. &ldquo;To-night I&rsquo;ve
half a mind to chuck my job and go out looking for mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Thrale.</p>
<p>Gurney sighed and began to analyse the instinct within himself, to
find precisely why he wanted to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must go,&rdquo; said Thrale, getting to his feet,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to find some sort of lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to stay with those Gosling people of
yours,&rdquo; said Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s off. I went to see them last night and they
won&rsquo;t have me. The old man&rsquo;s making his &pound;300 a year
now, and the family&rsquo;s too respectable to take boarders.&rdquo;
Thrale picked up his hat and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, look here, old chap, why the devil can&rsquo;t you stay
here?&rdquo; asked Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;d anywhere to put
me,&rdquo; said Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. There&rsquo;s always a room to be had
downstairs,&rdquo; said Gurney.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion the arrangement was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s understood I&rsquo;m to pay my whack,&rdquo; said
Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you insist&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Thrale had gone to fetch his luggage from the hotel, Gurney sat
pondering over the fire. He was debating whether he had been altogether
wise in pressing his invitation. He was wondering whether the curiously
rousing personality of Thrale, and the stories of those still existent
corners of the world outside the rules of civilization were good for a
civil servant with an income of &pound;600 a year. Gurney, faced with
the plain alternatives, could only decide that he would be a fool to
throw up a congenial and lucrative occupation such as his own, in order
to face present physical discomfort and future penury. He knew that the
discomforts would be very real to him at first. His friends would think
him mad. And all for the sake of experiencing some high emotion now and
again, in order to feel clean and fresh and be able to discover
something of the unknown mystery of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is something of the poet in me,&rdquo;
reflected Gurney. &ldquo;And I expect I should hate the discomforts.
One&rsquo;s imagination gets led away&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the next few evenings the conversations between
these two friends were many and protracted.</p>
<p>Thrale was the teacher, and Gurney was content to sit at his feet
and learn. He had a receptive mind, he was interested in all life, but
Uppingham, Trinity Hall, and the Home Civil had constricted his mental
processes. At twenty-nine he was losing flexibility. Thrale gave him
back his power to think, set him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>outside the formulas of his
school, taught him that however sound his deductions, there was not one
of his premises which could not be disputed.</p>
<p>Thrale was Gurney&rsquo;s senior by three years, and when Thrale
left Uppingham at eighteen, he had gone out into the world. He had a
patrimony of some &pound;200 a year; but he had taken only a lump sum
of &pound;100 and had started out to appease his furious curiosity
concerning life. He had laboured as a miner in the Klondike; had
sailed, working his passage as an ordinary seaman, from San Francisco
to Southampton; he had been a stockman in Australia, assistant to a
planter in Ceylon, a furnace minder in Kimberley and a tally clerk in
Hong Kong. For nearly nine years, indeed, he had earned a living in
every country of the world except Europe, and then he had come back to
London and invested the accumulation of income that his trustee had
amassed for him. The mere spending of money had no fascination for him.
During the six months he had remained in London he had lived very
simply, lodging with the Goslings in Kilburn, and, because he could not
live idly, exploring every corner of the great city and writing
articles for the journals. He might have earned a large income by this
latter means, for he had an originality of outlook and a freshness of
style that made his contributions eagerly sought after once he had
obtained a hearing&mdash;no difficult matter in London for anyone who
has something new to say. But experience, not income, was his desire,
and at the end of six months he had accepted an offer from the <i>Daily
Post</i> as a European <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span>correspondent&mdash;on space. He was offered
&pound;600 a year, but he preferred to be free, and he had no wish to
be confined to one capital or country.</p>
<p>In those five years he had traversed Europe, sending in his articles
irregularly, as he required money. And during that time his chief
trustee&mdash;a lawyer of the soundest reputation&mdash;had absconded,
and Thrale found his private income reduced to about &pound;40 a year,
the interest on one of the investments he had made, in his own name
only, with his former accumulation&mdash;two other investments made at
the same time had proved unsound.</p>
<p>This loss had not troubled him in any way. When he had read in a
London journal of his trustee&rsquo;s abscondence&mdash;he was later
sentenced to fourteen years&rsquo; penal servitude&mdash;Thrale had
smiled and dismissed the matter from his mind. He could always earn all
the money he required, and had never, not even subconsciously, relied
upon his private fortune.</p>
<p>He had now come back to London with a definite purpose, he had come
to warn England of a great danger&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>One other distinguishing mark of Jasper Thrale&rsquo;s life must be
understood, a mark which differentiated him from the overwhelming
majority of his fellow men&mdash;women had no fascination for him. Once
in his life, and once only, had he approached and tasted
experience&mdash;with a pretty little Melbourne <i>cocotte</i>. That
experience he had undertaken deliberately, because he felt that until
it had been undergone one great factor of life would be unknown to him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>He had come away from it filled with a disgust of
himself that had endured for months&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fragments of the long conversations between Thrale and
Gurney, the exchange of a few germane ideas among the irrelevant mass,
had a bearing upon their immediate future. There was, for instance, a
criticism of the Goslings, introduced on one occasion, which had a
certain significance in relation to subsequent developments.</p>
<p>Some question of Gurney&rsquo;s prompted Thrale to the opinion that
the Goslings were in the main precisely like half a million other
families of the same class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just what makes them so interesting,&rdquo;
said Gurney, not because he believed it, but because at the moment he
wanted to lead the conversation into safe ground, away from the too
appealing attractions of the big world outside the little village of
London.</p>
<p>Thrale laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s truer than you guess,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Every large generalization, however trite, is a valuable
contribution to knowledge&mdash;if it&rsquo;s more or less
accurate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generalize, then, mon vieux,&rdquo; suggested Gurney,
&ldquo;from the characters and doings of your little geese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen glimmerings of the immortal god in the old
man,&rdquo; said Thrale, &ldquo;like the hint of sunlight seen through
a filthy pane of obscured glass. He&rsquo;s a prurient-minded old beast
leading what&rsquo;s called a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>respectable life, but if he could
indulge his ruling desire with absolute secrecy, no woman would be safe
with him. In his world he can&rsquo;t do that, or thinks he
can&rsquo;t, which comes to precisely the same thing. He is too much
afraid of being caught, he sees danger where none exists, he looks to
all sorts of possibilities, and won&rsquo;t take a million-to-one
chance because he is risking his all&mdash;which is included in the one
word, respectability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jolly good thing. What?&rdquo; remarked Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for society as a whole, apparently,&rdquo; replied
Thrale, &ldquo;but surely not good for the man. I&rsquo;ve told you
that I have seen glimmerings of the god in him, but outside the routine
of his work the man&rsquo;s mind is clogged. He&rsquo;s not much over
fifty, and he has no outlet, now, for his desires. He&rsquo;s like a
man with choked pores, and his body is poisoned. And in this particular
Gosling is certainly no exception either to his class or to the great
mass of civilized man. Well, what I wonder is whether in a society
which is built up of interdependent units the whole can be sound when
the greater number of the constituent units are rotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, old chap,&rdquo; protested Gurney, &ldquo;if
things are as you say, and men rule the country, why shouldn&rsquo;t
they alter public opinion, and so open the way to do as they jolly well
please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the majority are too much ashamed of their desires to
dare the attempt in the first place, and in the second because they
don&rsquo;t wish to open the way for other men. They aren&rsquo;t
united in this; they are as jealous as women. If they once opened
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>the way to free love, their own belongings
wouldn&rsquo;t be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your remedy, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! a few thousand more years of moral development,&rdquo;
said Thrale, carelessly, &ldquo;an evolution towards
self-consciousness, a fuller understanding of the meaning of life, and
a finer altruism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look far ahead,&rdquo; remarked Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think anyone can look even a year ahead?&rdquo; asked
Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been some pretty good attempts in some
ways&mdash;Swedenborg, for instance, and Samuel
Butler&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s all right, in some ways&mdash;the
development of certain sorts of knowledge, for example. But there is
always the chance of the unpredictable element coming in and upsetting
the whole calculation. Some invention may do it, an unforeseen clash of
opinions or an epidemic&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they drifted further away from their original topic till
some remark reminded Gurney that he had meant to ask a question and had
forgotten it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wanted to ask you what
you meant when you said you had seen a god in old Gosling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a touch of imagination and wonder, now and again,&rdquo;
replied Thrale. &ldquo;Something he was quite unconscious of himself. I
remember standing with him on Blackfriars Bridge, and he looked down at
the river and said: &lsquo;I s&rsquo;pose it was clean once, banks and
sand and so on, before all this muck <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>came.&rsquo; Then he
looked at me quickly to see if I was laughing at him. That was the god
in him trying to create purity out of filth, even though it was only a
casual thought. It was smothered again at once. His training reasserted
itself. &lsquo;Lot better for trade the way it is, though,&rsquo; was
his next remark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you alter it?&rdquo; asked Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear chap, you can&rsquo;t alter these things by any
cut-and-dried plan, any more than you can dam the Gulf Stream. We can
only lay a brick or two in the right place. We aren&rsquo;t the
architects; the best of us are only bricklayers, and the best of the
best can only lay two or three bricks in a lifetime. Our job is to do
that if we can. We can only guess very feebly at the design of the
building; and often it is our duty partly to pull down the work that
our forefathers built&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently Gurney asked if his companion had ever seen a god in Mrs
Gosling.</p>
<p>Thrale shook his head. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t come within my
experience,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t condemn her on that
account, but she, like all the women I have ever met, has been too
intent upon the facts of life ever to see its mystery. Mrs Gosling
hadn&rsquo;t the power to conceive an abstract idea; she had to make
some application of it to her own particular experience before she
could understand the simplest concept. Morality to her signified people
who behaved as she and her family did; wickedness meant vaguely,
criminals, Sarah Jones who was an unmarried mother, and anyone who
didn&rsquo;t believe in the God of the Established Church. Always
people, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>you see, in this connexion; in others it might be
things; but ideas apart from people or things she couldn&rsquo;t grasp.
Her two daughters thought in precisely the same
way&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">One Saturday afternoon Thrale came into Gurney&rsquo;s
chambers and burst out: &ldquo;Just Heaven! why you fools stand it I
can&rsquo;t imagine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; asked Gurney.</p>
<p>Thrale sat down and drew his chair up to the table. The pupils of
his dark eyes were contracted and seemed to glow as if they were
illuminated from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in Oxford Street this morning, watching the women at
the sales,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All the biggest shops in London are
devoted to women&rsquo;s clothes. Do you realize that? And it&rsquo;s
not only that they&rsquo;re the biggest&mdash;there are more of them
than any other six trades put together can show, bar the drink trade,
of course. The north side of Oxford Street from Tottenham Court Road to
the Marble Arch is one long succession of huge drapers and milliners.
And what in God&rsquo;s name is the sense or reason of it? What do
these huge shops sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dresses, I suppose,&rdquo; ventured Gurney, &ldquo;and
stockings, underlinen, corsets, hats, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And</i> frippery,&rdquo; said Thrale, fixing his brilliant
dark eyes on Gurney, &ldquo;And <i>frippery</i>. Machine lace, ribbons,
yokes, cheap blouses, feathers, insertions, belts, fifty thousand
different kinds of bits and rags to be tacked on here and there, worn
for a few <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>weeks and then thrown away. Millions of little
frivolous, stupid odds and ends that are bought by women and girls of
all classes below the motor-class, to make a pretence&mdash;gauds and
tawdry rubbish not one whit better from the artistic point of view than
the shells and feathers of any half-naked Melanesian savage. In fact,
meaningless as the Melanesians&rsquo; decorations are, they do achieve
more effect. And what&rsquo;s it all for, I ask you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale paused, and Gurney offered his solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sex instinct, fundamentally, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;The desire&mdash;often subconscious, no doubt&mdash;to
attract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that is so,&rdquo; said Thrale, &ldquo;what terribly
unintelligent fools women must be! If women really set out to attract
men, they must realize that they are pandering to a sex instinct. Do
you think any man is attracted by a litter of odds and ends?
Doesn&rsquo;t every woman sneer when they see some Frenchwoman,
perhaps, who dresses to display her figure instead of hiding it?
Don&rsquo;t they bitterly resent the fact that their own men-folk are
resistlessly drawn to stare at, and inwardly desire, such a woman?
Don&rsquo;t they know perfectly well that such a woman is attractive to
men in a way their own disguised bodies can never be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, old chap; but your average middle-class English girl
hasn&rsquo;t got the physical attractions to start with,&rdquo; put in
Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it in another way, then,&rdquo; replied Thrale.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t every woman know perfectly
well&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you heard them say&mdash;that a nurse&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>dress is very becoming&mdash;a plain, more or less
tightly-fitting print dress, with linen collars and cuffs? Don&rsquo;t
you know yourself that that attire is more attractive to you than any
befrilled and bedecorated arrangement of lace, ribbons and gauds? Why
are so many men irresistibly attracted by parlourmaids and
housemaids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; meditated Gurney, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all true
enough. Well, are women all fools, or what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majority of women are <i>sheep</i>,&rdquo; said Thrale.
&ldquo;They follow as they are led, and don&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t see
that they are being led. And the leaders are chiefly men&mdash;men who
have trumpery to sell. Why do the fashions change every
year&mdash;sometimes more often than that in matters of detail? Because
the trade would smash if they didn&rsquo;t. New fashions must be forced
on the buyers, or the returns would drop; women would be able to make
their last year&rsquo;s clothes do for another summer. That must be
stopped at any cost. Those vast establishments must maintain an
enormous turnover if they are to pay their fabulous rents and armies of
assistants. There are two means of keeping up the sales, and both are
utilized to the full. The first is to supply cheap, miraculously cheap,
rubbish which cannot be made to last for more than a season. The second
is to alter the fashions which affect the more durable stuffs, so that
last year&rsquo;s dresses cannot be used again. This fashion-working
scheme reacts upon the poorer buyers, because it compels them to do
something to imitate the prevailing mode, if they can&rsquo;t afford to
have entirely new frocks. That is where all these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>bits of
frilling and what-not come in; make-believe stuff to imitate the real
buyers&mdash;the large majority of whom don&rsquo;t buy in Oxford
Street, by the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, there is a limit to the sheep-like docility of
women in this connexion. They refused, for instance, to return to the
crinoline, and they refused the harem skirt&mdash;one of the very few
sensible devices of the fashion-imposers. And this in the face of the
prolonged, strenuous and expensive methods of the fashion ring. With
regard to the crinoline, I think that failure was due to over-conceit
on the part of the fashion-imposers. They had come to believe that they
could make the poor fools of women accept anything, and on the two
marked occasions on which they attempted to introduce the crinoline,
the contrast to the existing mode was too glaring. If the fraud had
been worked more gradually by way of full skirts and flounces, some
modification of the crinoline to the necessities of &rsquo;buses and
tubes might have been foisted upon the buyers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Lord!&rdquo; ejaculated Gurney; &ldquo;do you mean to
say that women just accept these fashions without any sense or reason
at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather a blithering ass, at times,
Gurney,&rdquo; remarked Thrale.</p>
<p>Gurney smiled. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give me time to think,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I feel like an accumulator being charged. I
haven&rsquo;t had time yet to begin working on my own account.
You&rsquo;re so mighty&mdash;so mighty dynamic&mdash;and positive, old
chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s so absurdly obvious that there must be a
reason for women accepting the fashions, you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>idiot!&rdquo; returned Thrale. &ldquo;And the
first and biggest reason is class distinction. The women with money
want to brag of it by differentiating themselves from the ruck of their
sisters, and the poor women try to imitate them to the best of their
ability. Women dress for other women. There is sex rivalry as well as
class rivalry at the bottom of it, but they dare not put sex rivalry
first and dress to please men alone, because they are afraid of the
opinions of other women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds all right,&rdquo; said Gurney, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we, damned fools of men, stand all this foolishness and
<i>pay</i> for it. Pay, by Jove! I should think so! I should like to
see the trade returns of all the stuff of this kind that is sold in
England alone in one year. They would make the naval estimates look
small, I&rsquo;ll warrant. We even imitate the women&rsquo;s
foolishness in some degree. There are men&rsquo;s fashions too, but the
madness is not so marked; fortunately the body of middle-class men
can&rsquo;t afford to make fools of themselves as well as of their
women&mdash;though they are asses enough to wear linen shirts and
collars which are uncomfortable unsightly and expensive to
wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gurney regarded his lecturer&rsquo;s canvas shirt and collar, and
then stood up and observed his own immaculate linen in the glass over
the fireplace. &ldquo;I must say I like stiff collars and
shirts,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;gives one a kind of
spruceness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only another sex instinct,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Women like men to look &lsquo;smart.&rsquo; When you
are playing games with other men, or camping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>out, you
don&rsquo;t care a hang for your &lsquo;spruceness.&rsquo; Oh! and
I&rsquo;ll admit the class distinction rot comes in too. You&rsquo;re
afraid of public opinion, afraid of being thought common. If the
jeunesse dor&eacute;e started the soft shirt in real earnest, you would
soon be able to persuade your women that that looked smart or spruce,
or whatever you liked to call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, you know,&rdquo; said Gurney, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
an anarchist, that&rsquo;s what you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re half a woman, Gurney,&rdquo; said Thrale.
&ldquo;You think in names. All people are &lsquo;anarchists&rsquo; who
think in ideas instead of following conventions.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Not until he had been staying with Gurney for more
than a week did Thrale speak explicitly of his purpose in London. But
one cold evening at the end of January, as the two men were sitting by
a roaring fire that Gurney had built up, the younger man unknowingly
opened the subject by saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are pretty slack at the present moment. The <i>Evening
Chronicle</i> has even fallen back on the &lsquo;New Plague&rsquo; for
the sake of news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo; asked Thrale. He was lying back in
his chair, nursing one knee, and staring up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the usual rot!&rdquo; said Gurney &ldquo;That the thing
isn&rsquo;t understood, has never been &lsquo;described&rsquo; by any
medical or scientific authority; that it is apparently confined to one
little corner of Asia at the present time, but that if it got hold in
Europe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>it might be serious. And then a lot of yap about
the unknown forces of Nature; special article by a chap who&rsquo;s
been reading too much Wells, I should imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so incredible to us in twentieth-century England
that anything really serious could happen,&rdquo; remarked Thrale.
&ldquo;We are so well looked after and cared for. We sit down and wait
for some authority to move, with a perfect confidence that when it does
move, everything is bound to be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such an organism as society has become,&rdquo; said
Gurney, &ldquo;things must be worked like that. A certain group to
perform one function, other groups for other functions, and so
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cell-specialization?&rdquo; commented Thrale. &ldquo;Some day
to be perfected in socialism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe socialism must come in some form,&rdquo; said
Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s an interesting speculation, in some
ways,&rdquo; said Thrale, &ldquo;but the higher forces are about to put
a new spoke in the human wheel, and the machinery has to be stopped for
a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got hold of now?&rdquo; asked Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thoughtful man,&rdquo; went on Thrale, still staring up
at the ceiling, &ldquo;would have asked me to define my expression
&lsquo;the higher forces.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old man, I knew that was beyond even your
capacity,&rdquo; returned Gurney, &ldquo;so I thought we might
&lsquo;cut the cackle and come to the
&rsquo;osses.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale suddenly released his knee and sat upright; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>then he
moved his chair so that he directly confronted his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Gurney,&rdquo; he said, and the pupils of his eyes
contracted till they looked like black crystal glowing with dark red
light. &ldquo;Do you realize how some outside control has always
diverted man&rsquo;s progress; how when nations have tended to
crystallize into specialized government, some irruption from outside
has always broken it up? You can trace the principle through all known
history, but the most marked cases are those of the Egyptians and the
Incas&mdash;two nations which had developed specialized government to a
science. There is some power&mdash;whether we can credit it with an
intelligence in any way comprehensible to us from the feeble basis of
our own knowledge, I doubt&mdash;but there is some outside power which
will not permit mankind to crystallize into an organism. From our,
human, point of view, from the point of view of individual comfort and
happiness, it would be of enormous benefit to us if we could develop a
system of specialization and swamp the individual in the community. And
in times of peace and prosperity that is always the direction in which
civilization tends to evolve. But beyond a certain point&mdash;as the
individualists have not failed to point out&mdash;that state of perfect
government will lead to stagnation, degeneration, death. Now, in the
little span of time that we know as the history of mankind, there has
been no world-civilization. As soon as a nation tended to become
over-civilized and degenerate, some other, younger, more barbarous
people flowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>over them and wiped them out. In the case of Peru
the process had gone very far, owing to the advantages of the
Incas&rsquo; peculiar segregation. But then, you see, the development
in the East, the new world (I ought to explain that I find the oldest
civilization of the present epoch in America) reached a point in Spain
and England which sent them out across a hemisphere to wreck and
destroy the Incas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have now reached a condition when the nations are in
touch with one another and progress becomes more general. We are in
sight of a system of European, Colonial and Trans-Atlantic Socialism,
more or less reciprocal and carrying the promise of universal peace.
Whence, you ask, is any irruption to come that will break up this
strong crystallizing system which is admittedly to work for the
happiness and comfort of the individual? There has been much talk of an
Asiatic invasion, a rebellious India or an invading China, but those
civilizations are older than ours; if we can trust the precedents of
history in this connexion, the conquerors have always been the younger
race.&rdquo; He broke off abruptly.</p>
<p>Gurney had been sitting fascinated and hypnotized by the compulsion
of Thrale&rsquo;s personality; he had been held by the keen, intent
stare of those wonderful dark eyes. When Thrale stopped, however, the
tension snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Gurney, &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a
jolly good argument to prove that we have, at last, reached a stage of
universal progress towards the ideal.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t conceive,&rdquo; asked Thrale, &ldquo;of any
cataclysm that would involve a return to the old segregation of
nations, and bring about a new epoch beginning with separated peoples
evolving on more or less racial lines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gurney pondered for a moment or two and then shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little wonder,&rdquo; said Thrale, &ldquo;I had often
considered this problem, and I could think of no upheaval which would
bring about the familiar effect of submersion. Years ago there was
always the possibility of a European war, but even that would have only
a temporary effect despite the forecast of Mr Wells in <i>The War in
the Air</i>. No, I considered and wondered if my theory was faulty. I
was willing to reject it if I could find a
flaw&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; questioned Gurney.</p>
<p>Thrale leaned forward again and once more compelled the
other&rsquo;s fascinated attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, when I was in Northern China, seven weeks ago, I
saw a solution, so appalling, so inconceivably ghastly, that I rejected
it with horror. For days I went about fighting my own conviction. I
couldn&rsquo;t believe it! By God, I <i>would</i> not believe it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, within a hundred and fifty miles of the border of
Tibet, the outside forces have planted a seed which has been maturing
in secret for more than a year. There that seed has taken root, and
from that centre is spreading more and more rapidly, and it may spread
over the whole world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>It is like some filthily poisonous and
incredibly prolific weed, and its seeds, now that it has once
established itself, are borne by every wind, dropping here and there in
an ever-widening circle, every seed becoming a fresh centre of
distribution outwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, is the weed?&rdquo;
whispered Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new disease&mdash;a new plague&mdash;unknown by man,
against which, so far as we know, he has no weapon. In those scattered
villages among the mountains there are no men left to work. Everything
is done by women. They are prohibited more fiercely than any leper
settlement. No one dares to approach within five miles of them. But
every week or two another village is smitten, and the inhabitants fly
in terror and carry the infection with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gurney, it&rsquo;s come to Europe! There are new centres of
distribution in Russia at the present time. If it isn&rsquo;t stopped
it will come to England. And it doesn&rsquo;t decimate the population.
It wipes the men clean out of existence; not one man in ten thousand,
the Chinese say, escapes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that this can be the means of the
&lsquo;higher forces&rsquo; I spoke of, the means to segregate the
nations once more?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=

<p class="first">Jasper Thrale&rsquo;s mission was no easy one.
England, it appeared, was slightly preoccupied at the moment, and had
no ear for warnings. Generally, he was either treated as a fanatic and
laughed at, or he was told that he greatly exaggerated the danger and
that these matters could safely be entrusted to the Local Government
Board, which had brilliantly handled the recent outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease. But there were some exceptions to this
rule.</p>
<p>His first definite statement had been made to his own editor, Watson
Maxwell of the <i>Daily Post</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maxwell, when he had given Thrale a patient
hearing, &ldquo;it is certainly a matter that needs attention. Would
you care to go out as our special commissioner and report at
length?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; replied Thrale. &ldquo;The
thing is urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maxwell brought his eyebrows together and looked keenly at his
correspondent. &ldquo;Do you really think it&rsquo;s so serious,
Thrale?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;After all, what evidence have you,
beyond the Chinese reports?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know there are several cases in Russia,&rdquo; said Thrale.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I don&rsquo;t doubt that,&rdquo; returned Maxwell,
with a touch of impatience. &ldquo;But unless you can bring evidence to
show that this new disease is as deadly as you say, it is not a matter
that I could give space to at the present time. For one thing, the
<i>Evening Chronicle</i> has been making rather a feature of it for the
last three or four days, and I don&rsquo;t see that I could do much
unless we had some special inside information. Then, the House will be
sitting again next week, and it seems to me not altogether improbable
that we shall have a stormy session, which will mean that a good deal
of ordinary matter will have to give way&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; He
broke off, and then added, with a friendly smile: &ldquo;But if you
would go out as our commissioner, we should be glad to make you a
proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no need for a commissioner in a week&rsquo;s
time,&rdquo; replied Thrale. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to understand
that I&rsquo;m not looking out for a job. I don&rsquo;t want to write
articles; I don&rsquo;t want to be paid for the information I can
supply. I foresee a grave danger, which is growing more grave hourly by
reason of the Russian Government&rsquo;s censorship of all reports
referring to the plague. It is a danger which should be understood at
once. If you send any commissioner, send the cleverest physician you
can find, and a bacteriologist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There could be no doubt of Thrale&rsquo;s earnestness, and Maxwell,
who was not only a very capable editor, but also an able and
intellectual man, was impressed. Unfortunately, the interests of his
proprietors at that moment necessitated a great effort <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>to prop
up the very unstable Liberal Government, which had been in power for
four years and was now on its last legs. It was so essential from the
proprietors&rsquo; point of view&mdash;three of them were on the
Government front bench&mdash;that the dissolution should be postponed
until such time as the Ministry could go to the country with a
reasonable prospect of success. A tentative English Church
Disestablishment Bill was to be introduced in the coming session, and
it was hoped that if the Government had to go to the country they could
make a platform on that one clear issue. It was a good Bill, designed
to win the Nonconformist vote, without completely alienating the High
Church party. In other words, the Government was eager at that moment
to please the majority of the electors, which is, presumably, the
highest object of a representative government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it had been at any other time,&rdquo; said Maxwell, and
pushed his chair back.</p>
<p>Thrale understood that the interview was at an end. He rose from his
chair and picked up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be glad to print any articles you care to send
us,&rdquo; said Maxwell, with his kind smile, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t
undertake a campaign, you understand, at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly four o&rsquo;clock, but Thrale just managed to catch
Groves of the <i>Evening Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p class="first">Groves had his hat on, and was just off to tea at his
club when Thrale&rsquo;s name was sent in to him. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>told the
messenger that he would see Mr Thrale in the waiting-room
downstairs.</p>
<p>Thrale had had some experience of newspaper methods, and he inferred
that the reception was equivalent to a refusal to see him. He knew what
those interviews in downstairs waiting-rooms implied. It was not the
first time that he had been treated like an insurance agent or a
tradesman and told, in effect, &ldquo;Not to-day, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this case he was mistaken in his inference. Groves had had an eye
on Thrale&rsquo;s articles for some time past, and though he thought it
a diplomatic essential to keep his man waiting for ten minutes, he had
no intention of offending him.</p>
<p>Groves came into the waiting-room with a slightly abstracted air.
&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting Mr Thrale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
fact is, that I wanted to finish before I left. Did you want to see me
about anything particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Thrale; &ldquo;I have some facts about
the new plague which ought to be given publicity at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groves pursed his thick lips and shook his head. &ldquo;Well,
well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you come and have tea with me at the
club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took Thrale&rsquo;s assent for granted, and went out abruptly,
leaving his guest to follow.</p>
<p>In the taxicab Groves talked of nothing but the lack of originality
in invention in reference to aeroplanes. He seemed to take it as a
personal affront that no workable adaptation of the aeroplane had been
made to short-distance passenger traffic. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p>Indeed, it was not till after &ldquo;tea&rdquo;&mdash;in
Groves&rsquo; case an euphemism for whisky and soda&mdash;that he would
approach the subject of Thrale&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that our
campaign hasn&rsquo;t caught on. I&rsquo;m going to let it down gently
and drop it after to-day&rsquo;s edition. You see, we&rsquo;ve got to
get the Government out this session, and I&rsquo;m going to start a new
campaign. Can&rsquo;t give you any particulars yet, but you&rsquo;ll
see the beginning of it next Monday.&rdquo; Like Maxwell, Groves
differentiated between the uses of the singular and plural pronouns in
speaking of his work. There was a distinction to be inferred between
the initiation and responsibilities of the editor and those of his
proprietors.</p>
<p>Groves was not at all impressed by any earnestness or forebodings.
He seemed to think that a touch of the plague in London might be rather
a good thing in some ways. People wanted waking up&mdash;especially to
the importance of getting rid of the present Government.</p>
<p>It appeared that Thrale&rsquo;s articles on other subjects would be
acceptable to the readers of the <i>Evening Chronicle</i>, but there
was no suggestion that he should go out to Russia as a special
commissioner.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Grant Lacey, of <i>The Times</i>, listened seriously
to Thrale&rsquo;s exposition, and then, in a finely delivered speech
which lasted twenty minutes, proved to his own complete satisfaction
that Thrale&rsquo;s <span class="corr" id="xd26e899" title=
"Source: premisses">premises</span>, deductions, and whole argument
were thoroughly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>unsound. Lacey, however, was greatly interested in
the condition of Russia, and promised Thrale magnificent terms if he
would tour St Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Warsaw&mdash;and then return
and contribute a special series of articles. References to the new
plague would not be prohibited in the series if Thrale still found any
cause for alarm.</p>
<p>In all, Thrale had interviews with the editors of nine important
journals; the other six developed on the general lines already
indicated&mdash;either he was not taken seriously or was told that the
danger was greatly exaggerated. The real causes of his failure were
two:&mdash;first, the critical position of the Government; second, the
precocious campaign of the <i>Evening Chronicle</i>&mdash;the latter
had taken the wind out of the sails of less enterprising journals.</p>
<p>Thrale&rsquo;s next step was to obtain introductions to Ministers
and prominent members of the Opposition; but from them he received even
less attention&mdash;he did not obtain interviews on many
occasions&mdash;and, if possible, less encouragement. The President of
the Local Government Board informed him that the matter was already
engaging that department&rsquo;s energies; the others were all
manifestly preoccupied with more immediate interests.</p>
<p>But little less than a fortnight after the initiation of his
campaign Thrale received a special message from the editor of the
<i>Daily Post</i>. It was nearly midnight, and the messenger was
waiting with a taxicab.</p>
<p>The message ran: &ldquo;Received through news agency report of three
cases of plague in Berlin. Can you come down at
once?&mdash;Maxwell.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=

<p class="first">Jasper Thrale, in the partial exposition of his
philosophy (if that description is not too large for such vague
imaginings), had included very definite reference to certain
&ldquo;higher forces&rdquo; to which he had attributed peculiar powers
of interference in humanity&rsquo;s management of its own concerns.
Doubtless these powers had control of various instruments, and were
able to exercise their influence in any direction and by any means. In
the present case it would seem that they were working in devious and
subtle ways&mdash;and in this at least they differed not at all from
the methods attributable to that we have called Providence, or the Laws
of Nature; any assumed guide or irrefragible, incomprehensible
ordination. It is a common characteristic of these forces that they
seem able to control the inconceivably great and the inconceivably
small with equal certitude.</p>
<p>Not that George Gosling touched any limits. He was moderately large
in body and small in intellect, but neither the physical excess nor the
mental deficiency marked him out from his fellow men. In the office,
indeed, he was regarded by the firm and his colleagues as a capable man
of business whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"
name="pb46">46</a>]</span>embonpoint was quite consistent with his
employment by a firm of wholesale provision merchants.</p>
<p>On the Thursday morning that saw the announcement in the morning
papers that a case of the new plague was reported in Berlin, Gosling
was called into the partners&rsquo; private office on some matter of
accountancy.</p>
<p>The senior partner of Barker and Prince was eager, grasping and
imaginative; his name had originally been German, and ended, in
&ldquo;stein,&rdquo; but he had changed it for the convenience of his
English connexion. Prince was a large rubicund man, friendly and noisy
in his manners, but accounted a shrewd buyer.</p>
<p>It was not until Gosling was about to depart that the higher forces
turned their attention to Barbican and then they suddenly urged Gosling
to say, without premeditation on his part,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see there&rsquo;s a case of this &rsquo;ere new plague in
Berlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Prince laughed and winked at his subordinate. &ldquo;Some of
us&rsquo;ll have to start a hareem, soon; who knows?&rdquo; he said,
and laughed again, more loudly than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you haf not heard any other reports, eh?&rdquo;
asked Mr Barker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, curiously enough, I &rsquo;ave,&rdquo; said Gosling.
&ldquo;A young feller who used to lodge with us five years back, come
&rsquo;ome from Russia about a fortnight since, and &rsquo;e tells me
as the plague&rsquo;s spreadin&rsquo; like wildfire in
Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Prince laughed again, and Mr Barker seemed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>about to
turn his attention to other matters, when the higher forces sent
Gosling the one great inspiration of his life. It came to him with
startling suddenness, but he gave utterance to it as simply and with as
little verve as he spoke his &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; to the
office-boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been thinkin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; he said (he had never once
thought of it until this moment), &ldquo;as it might be well to keep a
neye on this plague, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Zo?&rdquo; said Mr Barker; a phrase which Gosling
correctly interpreted as the expression of a desire for the elucidation
of his last remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I been thinkin&rsquo;, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me,
sir,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;as though the plague&rsquo;s only in the
bud, so to speak, at the present time, it seems very likely to spread
so far as we can judge; and that what with quarantine, p&rsquo;raps,
and p&rsquo;raps shortage of labour and so on, it might mean
&rsquo;igher prices for our stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zo!&rdquo; said Mr Barker, but this time the monosyllable was
reflective. The great inspiration had found fruitful soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brince,&rdquo; continued Barker after a minute&rsquo;s
thought, &ldquo;I haf a flair. We will buy heavily at once. But not
through our London house, no; or others will follow us too quickly.
<i>You</i> must not go, we will zend Ztewart from Dundee, it will zeem
that we prepare for the zhipping strike in the north. We buy heavily;
yes? I haf a flair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I say,&rdquo; said Mr Prince, who had the greatest
confidence in his partner&rsquo;s insight, &ldquo;I say, Barker,
d&rsquo;you think this plague&rsquo;s serious?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am putting money on it, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; asked
Barker.</p>
<p>Prince and Gosling exchanged a scared glance. Until that moment it
had not come home to either of them that it was possible for English
affairs to be affected by this strange and deadly disease.</p>
<p>The remainder of the conversation was complicated and exceedingly
technical.</p>

<p class="first">When he came back into the counting-house, Gosling
looked unnaturally thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything gorne wrong?&rdquo; asked his crony, Flack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the &rsquo;ouse, if
that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; replied Gosling mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; asked Flack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this &rsquo;ere new plague,&rdquo; returned
Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tchah! That&rsquo;s all my eye,&rdquo; said Flack. He was a
narrow-chested, high-shouldered man of sixty, with a thin grey beard,
and he had a consistently incredulous mind.</p>
<p>Out here in the counting-house, Gosling&rsquo;s thrill of fear was
rapidly subsiding, and he had no intention of passing over his own
important part in the house&rsquo;s decision to buy for a rise; so he
bulged out his cheeks, shook his head and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by a long chalk it ain&rsquo;t, Flack; not by a long
chalk. There was that young feller, Thrale, as I was tellin&rsquo; you
about; &rsquo;e gave me a hidea or two, and now s&rsquo;mornin&rsquo;
we &rsquo;ave this very serious news from Berlin.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Papers &rsquo;ave to make the worst of everything,&rdquo;
said Flack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their livin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyways,&rdquo; continued Gosling, &ldquo;I put it quite
straight to the &rsquo;ouse this mornin&rsquo;, as we might do worse
under the circumstances than buy
&rsquo;eavily&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>did</i>?&rdquo; asked Flack, and he cocked up his
spectacles and looked at Gosling underneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Mr Barker say to that?&rdquo; asked Flack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took my advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s sakes, you don&rsquo;t tell me so?&rdquo; said
Flack, his spectacles on his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m now about to dictate various letters to our
&rsquo;ouse in Dundee,&rdquo; replied Gosling, dropping his voice to a
whisper, and assuming an air of mysterious importance, &ldquo;advising
them to send our Mr Stewart to Vienna immediate, from where &rsquo;e is
to proceed to Berlin. &rsquo;E is, also, to &rsquo;ave private
instructions from the &rsquo;ouse as to the extent of &lsquo;is
buyin&rsquo;&mdash;which I may tell you in confidence, Flack, will be
enormous&mdash;e-<i>nor</i>mous.&rdquo; Gosling raised his head slowly
on the first syllable, brought it down with a jerk on the second, and
left the third largely to the imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But d&rsquo;yer mean to tell me,&rdquo; expostulated Flack,
&ldquo;as all this is on account of this plague? They been usin&rsquo;
that as a blind, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling laid a bunch of swollen fingers on his colleague&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;I tell you, Flack, old boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
this is serious. When Mr Barker took up my advice, as &rsquo;e did very
quick, Mr Prince said, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me as you really
take this plague serious, Barker?&rsquo; &rsquo;e said. And Mr Barker
looked up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>and says, <span class="corr" id="xd26e1023" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to put all my
money on it.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Gosling paused and then repeated,
&ldquo;Mr Barker says as &rsquo;e&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to put all our
money on it, Flack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s sakes!&rdquo; said Flack. Here, indeed, was an
argument strong enough to break down even his consistent incredulity.
&ldquo;But d&rsquo;yer mean to tell me,&rdquo; he persisted,
&ldquo;that Mr Barker thinks as it&rsquo;ll come to England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-el, you know,&rdquo; returned Gosling, &ldquo;we need not,
p&rsquo;raps go quite so far as that. But it may go far enough to
interfere with European markets, there may be trouble with quarantine,
and such-like&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, that,&rdquo; said Flack with an air of relief.
&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; <i>so</i>, jus&rsquo; <i>so</i>. Mr Barker can see as
far through a brick wall as most people, and so I&rsquo;ve always
said.&rdquo; He dropped his spectacles on to his nose again, and
returned to his interrupted accountancy.</p>
<p>Gosling went fussily into his own room and rang for his
typist&mdash;a competent and presentable young woman, among whose
duties that of turning her superior&rsquo;s letters into equivalent
English was not the lightest.</p>

<p class="first">Gosling was very full of importance that day, and
during lunch he wore the air of a man who had secret and valuable
information. He was too well versed in City methods and too loyal to
his own house to give any hint of Barker and Prince&rsquo;s
speculations in Austria and Germany; but when the subject of the new
plague inevitably came into the conversation, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>he spoke
with an authority that was heightened by the hint of reserve implicit
in his every dictum.</p>
<p>When the latest joke on the subject, fresh from the Stock Exchange,
had been retailed by one of the usual group of lunchers, and had been
received with the guffaws it merited, Gosling suddenly screwed his face
to an unaccustomed seriousness and said, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s serious,
you know, extremely serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by degrees, from this and many other better informed sources,
the rumour ran through the City that the new plague was serious,
extremely serious. That afternoon there was a slight drop of prices in
certain industrial shares, and a slight rise in wheat and some other
imported food stuffs; fluctuations which could not be attributed to
ordinary causes. Mr Barker&rsquo;s foresight was justified once again
in the eyes of Gosling and Flack. Before five o&rsquo;clock another
letter was posted to Dundee, enforcing haste.</p>
<p>In the bosom of his family that evening, Gosling was a little
pompous, and talked of economy. But his wife and daughters, although
they assumed an air of interest, were quite convinced that the head of
the house in Wisteria Grove was making the most of a rumour for his own
purposes.</p>
<p>As Blanche said to Millie, later, father was always finding some
excuse for keeping them short of dress money. That five pounds had
proved inadequate to supply even their immediate necessities, and they
were already meditating another attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We simply must get another three pounds somehow,&rdquo; said
Millie. And Blanche quite agreed with her. <span class=

<p class="first">There was a lull for forty-eight hours after that
announcement of the case of the new plague in Berlin, and Maxwell was
beginning to regret his headlines when the news began to come in, this
time in volume. The Russian censorship had broken down, and the news
agencies were suddenly flooded with reports. There were several
thousand cases of the plague in Eastern Russia; the north and south
were affected, many men were dying in such towns as Kharkov and Rostov;
there were a dozen cases in St Petersburg; there was a such a rush of
reports that it was quite impossible to distinguish between those that
were probably true and those that were certainly false.</p>
<p>The morning papers gave as much space as they could spare, and had
even broken up some of the matter dealing with the arrangements for the
opening of Parliament on that day. But the evening papers had news that
put all previous reports in the shade. Eleven more cases were reported
in Berlin<span class="corr" id="xd26e1071" title=
"Not in source">,</span> three in Hamburg, five in Prague and one in
Vienna<span class="corr" id="xd26e1074" title="Not in source">.</span>
But more important, more thrilling still, was the news that H.I.H. the
Grand Duke Kirylo, the Tsar&rsquo;s younger brother, had died of the
plague in Moscow, and Professor Schlesinger in Berlin. Until that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>startling announcement came, the English public
had incomprehensibly imagined that only peasants, Chinamen and people
of the lower social grades were attacked by this strange new
infection.</p>
<p>In the later editions it was reported on good authority that
Professor Schlesinger had been observing a sample of the blood of the
first case of plague that had been recognized in Berlin.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the majority of readers, after glancing through the
obituary notices of H.I.H. the Grand Duke Kirylo and of the world-famed
bacteriologist, turned to the account&mdash;only slightly
abbreviated&mdash;of the opening of Parliament. And in many households
the subject of the new plague gave place to the fiercely controversial
topic of the English Church Disestablishment Bill, which had been
indicated in the King&rsquo;s Speech as a measure that was to be
introduced in the forthcoming session. Many opponents of the Bill
coupled the two chief items of news and said that the plague was a
warning against infidelity. It may be assumed that they found
sufficient warrant for the killing of a few thousand Russians,
including a prince of the blood and a great German scientist, in the
acknowledged importance of England among the nations. The death of half
a million or so Chinamen in the first instance had been a delicate
hint; now came the more urgent warning. Who knew but that if this
sacrilegious Bill were passed, England herself might not be smitten.
When warnings are disregarded, judgments follow. The Evangelicals found
a weapon ready to their hands&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>But what precisely was the nature of the new plague, none of the
journals was as yet able to say. The symptoms had not as yet been
&ldquo;described&rdquo; by any medical authority, for it appeared that,
contrary to modern precedent, the doctor himself, despite all
precautions, was peculiarly subject to infection. Out of the eleven new
cases in Berlin, no less than four were medical men.</p>
<p>From the layman&rsquo;s point of view the symptoms were briefly as
follows: Firstly, violent pains at the base of the skull, followed by a
period of comparative relief which lasted from two to five hours. Then,
a numbness in the extremities, followed by rapid paralysis. Death
ensued in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours after the pains were
first experienced. No case, as yet, was known to have recovered. A
well-known physician in London gave it as his opinion that the disease
was a hitherto unknown form of cerebro-spinal meningitis of unexampled
virulence. He protested that the word &ldquo;plague&rdquo; was a false
description, but that word had already been impressed on the public
mind, and the disease was spoken of as the &ldquo;new plague&rdquo;
until the end.</p>

<p class="first">The next morning all London was reading a
heavily-leaded article by Jasper Thrale. It appeared first in the
<i>Daily Post</i>, with the announcement that it was not copyright, and
all the evening papers took it up, and some of them reprinted it in its
entirety.</p>
<p>The article began by pointing out that in the recent history of
civilization Europe had been subject <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>to a long succession of
pestilences. From the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, wrote
Thrale, the Black Death, now commonly supposed to be a form of the
bubonic plague, was practically endemic in England. In more recent
times small-pox had been responsible for enormous mortality among all
classes, and, in our own day, tuberculosis. In the two former examples,
Thrale pointed out, and in many other diseases, infectious or
contagious, or both, these pestilences had gradually lost virulence. By
the elimination of those most susceptible to infection and incapable to
resist the onslaught of the disease, and by the survival of those whose
vitality was strong enough either to resist attack or to achieve
recovery, mankind at last were gradually becoming immune against
certain infections which had prevailed in the past. And in a greater or
less degree this immunity was without doubt being obtained against a
whole host of lesser ills. This comparative immunity, in fact, was one
of the means of man&rsquo;s evolution towards a more perfect physical
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us consider for a moment,&rdquo; wrote Thrale,
&ldquo;the appalling danger which threatens us when we are attacked by
a pestilence which is entirely new to humanity; new, so far as we know,
to the world. In the middle of the fourteenth century the Black Death
is recorded in some places to have killed two-thirds of the whole
population, and, notwithstanding the modern improvement in sanitation
and general hygiene, there is no inherent reason why another pestilence
may not appear, which may be even more deadly. And we are faced at the
present <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>moment with the awful threat that such a
pestilence has appeared, the pestilence commonly known as the
&lsquo;new plague.&rsquo; There is no reason why we should consider the
appearance as without precedent in history; there is no reason why we
should regard its coming as outside the laws of common probability;
finally, and most decisively, there is no reason why England should not
be smitten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to report among the Chinese, this &lsquo;new
plague&rsquo; has been spasmodically epidemic in Tibet for more than a
century. We have, as yet, no certain facts upon which to base any
hypothesis, but is it not credible that during that time some bacterium
or bacillus&mdash;hitherto harmlessly parasitic, perhaps, in the blood
of lower animals&mdash;has changed its life habit? In the isolated and
sparsely inhabited regions of Tibet, it is possible that for many
thousand years the assumed bacterium was never bred in the blood of
man; it is possible that when it first found a new host it was
comparatively harmless to him, but within a hundred years it may have
become so altered by new conditions that it has developed into what is
practically a new species. If these theories are relatively true, it is
not unlikely that this new bacterium is working out its own destruction
by the destruction of its hosts. It may be that it is one of those
blind alleys of evolution which reach a certain stage of development
and then disappear. But meanwhile what of mankind? We know so little of
the history of microscopic life. There is a whole world of evolution in
process of which we have no conception, and at this stage, whether my
hypothesis be a possible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>one or not, we are at least sure that
an unknown organism&mdash;animal or vegetable&mdash;has become visible
to us in its effects and may alter the whole history of mankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lay stress on these aspects, because we are so hide-bound,
so restricted, so conventional in our ideas that we assume, without
thought, that the process of life as we know of it from a few thousand
years of history can never be interrupted. In our few years of
individual existence we become accustomed to certain apparent laws of
cause and effect, and will not believe that there can be any exception
to those assumed laws. But, now, in the face of recent evidence, it is
absolutely essential that we should realize instantly and practically
that we are threatened with a new factor in life, which imperils the
whole human race. It is no longer safe to comfort ourselves with the
belief&mdash;begotten of our vanity&mdash;that the world was
necessarily made for man. It behoves us to take measures for our
protection without delay, to undertake our own cause and trust no
longer in any beneficent Providence that works always for our ultimate
benefit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These measures of protection are clearly indicated. We must
close our doors against the invasion of the plague. Quarantine will not
protect us; we must have no traffic with Europe until the danger is
past. By the happy accident of our position we can become isolated from
the rest of the world. We must close our doors before it is too
late.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=

<p class="first">If the people had not been seriously scared by the
sudden irruption of news on the day preceding that on which this
article was published, they would have ignored Thrale&rsquo;s
hyperboles&mdash;or laughed. But, caught in a moment of agitation and
fear, a certain section of the crowd took up Thrale&rsquo;s suggestion,
talked about the &ldquo;closed door,&rdquo; held meetings, and started
propaganda. The Press, with its genius for appreciating and following
public opinion, also took up the suggestion, and was automatically
divided into two sections, recognizable as Liberal and
Conservative.</p>
<p><i>The Times</i> took command of the situation with a leader, in
which Thrale&rsquo;s argument was pounded, rather than picked, to
pieces; but the <i>Daily Mail</i> produced more effect with two special
articles contributed, one by a bacteriologist, the other by a professor
of economics. The first had little weight&mdash;all argument under that
head was as yet founded on the most uncertain hypotheses. The second
was so convincing that the less ardent supporters of the &ldquo;closed
door&rdquo; policy were shaken in their convictions.</p>
<p>The writer of the economic article pointed out that an England with
closed doors could not feed herself for a month. He was scrupulously
fair in his argument, and was at great pains to show that even if
preparation was instantly made to lay in large stores of grain from
Canada, tinned meats from America, and food-stuffs generally from the
many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>places which were as yet free from any taint of
plague, it would still be impossible to provide for more than a three
months&rsquo; isolation. Then, leaving this aspect of the question, he
went on to show in detail that even if the food could be supplied, the
practical cessation of our enormous foreign trade would mean the
destruction of England&rsquo;s commerce, and he wound up with an
earnest exhortation to the country at large, warning the people to
beware of scaremongers, pessimists, and opportunists who had their own
ends to serve, and cared nothing for the general welfare. It was an
excellent article in every way; quite one of the best that the <i>Daily
Mail</i> had ever published. And as this, too, was declared free of any
copyright restrictions, it was largely circulated.</p>
<p>The <i>Daily Post</i> replied next morning by pointing out that the
celebrated professor of economics was nullifying all his own previous
utterances on the case for Tariff Reform, but that retort carried
little weight. No one cared if the professor contradicted himself;
anyone, except the faddists, could see that the argument of the article
was sound, in fact incontrovertible. What had to be done was to put
pressure on the Local Government Board. It was true that the <i>Daily
Post</i>, the semi-official organ of the Government, affirmed that the
Board in question was alert and active, but that announcement was
regarded as a clich&eacute;; what was wanted were particulars of the
preventive measures that were being taken.</p>
<p>The members of the great Gosling family, in offices, warehouses and
shops followed the line of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href=
"#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>least resistance, while making some
assertion of their rights as citizens.</p>
<p>George Gosling&rsquo;s arguments with his crony Flack were
excellently representative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What yer think of this &lsquo;closed door&rsquo;
business?&rdquo; asked Flack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; a bit <i>too</i> far, in my opinion,&rdquo;
returned Gosling judicially.</p>
<p>Flack&rsquo;s natural incredulity had inclined him in the same
direction, but his colleague&rsquo;s certainty swung him round at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Looks to me as things is going pretty bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad enough, I grant you,&rdquo; returned Gosling. &ldquo;But
there isn&rsquo;t no need for us to lose our &rsquo;eads over it. Take
it all round, you know, it&rsquo;s pretty certain as things isn&rsquo;t
as bad as is made out, whereas, on the other &rsquo;and, the
&lsquo;closed door&rsquo; policy&rsquo;d mean ruin and starvation for
&rsquo;undreds of thousands&mdash;there&rsquo;s no gettin&rsquo; round
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better a few &rsquo;undred thousands than the &rsquo;ole male
population,&rdquo; said Flack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it come to that, but it won&rsquo;t; no fear, not by a
long chalk, it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Gosling. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
got to be done is to get the Local Government Board to work.
We&rsquo;ve got to &rsquo;ave a regular system o&rsquo; quarantine
established, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to
&rsquo;ave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did, indeed, appear the most practical form of prevention at the
moment; it is hard to see what other measures could have been adopted.
The supporters of the &ldquo;closed door&rdquo; policy soon began to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>lose adherents. The scheme was obviously alarmist,
far-fetched and utterly impracticable&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Through February and the early part of March the
plague spread through Central Europe, but not with an alarming
rapidity.</p>
<p>In the second week of March, Berlin was reporting a weekly roll of
over five hundred deaths attributable to this cause, and Vienna was
second with between four and five hundred. In St Petersburg and Moscow
the figures were no higher, and there were as yet comparatively few
cases in France, and none in Spain or Portugal.</p>
<p>Many authorities were of opinion that the mortality had reached the
maximum, and that the plague would work itself out in the course of a
few more weeks. Moreover it appeared that the early reports of the
highly infectious character of the plague must have been grossly
exaggerated, for as yet there had been not a single case in the British
Isles despite the enormous traffic between England and the Continent.
It is true that the strictest quarantine had been established&mdash;it
had been ascertained that the period of gestation of the germ was about
fifty hours&mdash;but not one single case had so far been detained in
quarantine ships or hospitals. It was argued from this that the plague
was not infectious at all in the ordinary sense, and only mildly
contagious; that it flourished in certain centres and was not easily
transferable from one centre to another.</p>
<p>The only aspect of the thing that was seriously <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>alarming
was the horrible mortality among doctors and the specialists who were
endeavouring to recognize and isolate the characteristic germ of the
disease. Nine English experts who had dared martyrdom in the cause of
science had gone to Berlin to make investigations, and not one of them
had returned<span class="corr" id="xd26e1181" title=
"Not in source">.</span> As a consequence of this strange
susceptibility of the investigator, whether medical man or
bacteriologist, there was still an extraordinary ignorance of the
general nature and action of the disease.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite this one intimidating aspect of the plague,
the general attitude in the middle of March was that the quarantine
arrangements were enormously impeding trade and should be
relaxed<span class="corr" id="xd26e1186" title="Not in source">.</span>
The foreign governments were alive to the seriousness of the scourge,
and were doing all in their power to prevent infection. There had been
a scare, but people were calm again, now, and able to realize the
extent of the earlier exaggerations.</p>
<p>The Government passed the second reading of the English Church
Disestablishment Bill by a majority of nineteen, before the Easter
recess, and the Goslings, who had grown used to the plague, whose chief
attitude towards it was that it was an infernal nuisance which
interfered with trade, turned their attention gladly to the new topic;
they all thought that a general election at that moment would result in
an overwhelming Conservative majority. And as the Liberals had been in
power for more than ten years, that eventuality was regarded with
complacency.</p>
<p>But at this critical moment&mdash;to the joy of the
Evangelicals&mdash;the new plague set to work in earnest. <span class=

<p class="first">Russia was smitten. Once more communication was cut
off from Moscow, this time by a different agent<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1204" title="Not in source">.</span> The work of the city was
paralysed. Men were falling dead in the street, and there were only
women to bury them. A wholesale emigration had begun. The roads were
choked with people on foot and in carriages, for the trains had ceased
to run.</p>
<p>The news filtered in by degrees: it was confirmed, contradicted and
definitely confirmed again every few hours.</p>
<p>Then came final confirmation, with the news that something
approaching war had broken out&mdash;a war of defence. Germany had sent
troops to the frontier to stem the tide of emigrants from smitten
Russia and Poland; and Austria-Hungary was following her example.</p>
<p>Parliament re-assembled before the Easter recess had expired. The
time for more drastic measures had come, and the Premier explained to
the House that it was proposed to bring in a Bill immediately to cut
off communication with Europe.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that England was now badly scared, but
centuries of protection had established a belief in security which was
not easily shaken.</p>
<p>The enthusiasts for the &ldquo;closed door&rdquo; policy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>found plenty of recruits, but on the other side
there was a solid body of opinion which maintained that the danger was
grossly exaggerated. And when the <i>Evening Chronicle</i> came out
with a long leader and a backing of expert opinion, to prove that the
&ldquo;Closed Door&rdquo; Bill&mdash;as it was commonly
called&mdash;was a dodge of the Government&rsquo;s in order to retain
office, a well-marked reaction followed against the last and terrible
step of cutting off all communication with Europe; and the Conservative
party was joined by some avowed Liberals who had personal interests to
consider in this connexion.</p>
<p>In committee-rooms, members of the Opposition were inclined to be
jubilant: &ldquo;If we can throw out the Government on this Bill we
shall simply sweep the country &hellip; all the manufacturers in the
North will be with us &hellip; even Scotland, most likely &hellip; we
should come back with a record majority&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prospects were so magnificent that there could be no hesitation
in making a party question of the Bill.</p>
<p>No time was to be lost, for the Bill was to be rushed, it was an
emergency measure, and it was proposed that it should become law within
four days. Preparations were already in hand to carry out the
provisions enacted.</p>
<p>An urgent rally of the Opposition was made, and when the Bill came
up for the second reading the Premier addressed a well-filled House.
The House was not crowded because a large number of people, including
many members of Parliament, were on their way to America. All the big
liners were packed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>on their outward voyage and were returning,
contrary to all precedent, in ballast&mdash;this ballast was
exclusively food-stuffs.</p>
<p>The Premier introduced the Bill in a speech which was remarkable for
its sincerity and earnestness. He outlined the arrangements that were
being made to feed the community, and showed clearly that while
communication remained open with America, there was no fear of any
serious shortage. Pausing for a moment on this question of intercourse
with America, he made a point of the fact that American ports were
already closed to emigrants from all European countries with the one
exception of Great Britain, and that if a single case of plague were
reported in these islands the difficulties of obtaining food-stuffs
from America and the Colonies would be enormously increased. He wound
up by almost imploring the House not to make a party question of so
urgent and necessary a measure at a time when the safety of England was
so terribly threatened. He pleaded that at this critical moment,
unparalleled in the history of humanity, it was the duty of every man
to sink his own personal interests, to be ready to make any sacrifice,
for the sake of the community.</p>
<p>Mr Brampton, the leader of the Opposition, then completely destroyed
the undoubted effect which had been made upon the House. He did not
openly speak in a party spirit, but he hinted very plainly that the
Bill under consideration was a mere subterfuge to win votes. He poured
contempt upon the fear of the plague, which he characterized throughout
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>as the &ldquo;Russian epidemic,&rdquo; and ended
with the advice to keep a cool head, to preserve the British spirit of
sturdy resistance instead of shutting our doors and bringing the
country to commercial ruin. &ldquo;Are we all cravens,&rdquo; he
concluded, &ldquo;scurrying like rabbits to our burrows at the first
hint of alarm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The further debate, although lengthy, had comparatively little
influence; the House divided, and the Government was defeated by a
majority of nine.</p>

<p class="first">The news was all over the country by ten o&rsquo;clock
that night, and it was noticeable that a large percentage of the
younger generation still regarded the danger as &ldquo;rather a
lark.&rdquo; This threat of the plague held a promise of high
adventure; youth can only realize the possibility of death in its
relation to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, if this bally old plague did come&rdquo; &hellip;
remarked a young man of twenty-two, who was sitting with a friend in
the little private bar of the &ldquo;Dun Taw&rdquo; Hotel.</p>
<p>His friend drew his feet up on to the rungs of his tall stool and
winked at the barmaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on. What if it did?&rdquo; remarked that young
woman.</p>
<p>The young man considered for a moment and then said: &ldquo;Those
that got left would have a rare old time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the women as&rsquo;d get left, seems to me,&rdquo;
replied the barmaid, and scored a point. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, surely you don&rsquo;t come from this part of the
world?&rdquo; was the compliment evoked by her wit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Londoner, I
am. Only started yesterday, and sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay long if
to-day&rsquo;s a fair sample. There &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t been a dozen
customers in all day, and they were in such a &rsquo;urry to get their
tonic and go that I&rsquo;m sure they couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave told
you whether me &rsquo;air was black or ches&rsquo;nut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men immediately looked at the crown of pretty fair hair which
had been so churlishly slighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First thing I noticed about you,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>The other, who had hardly spoken before, took the cigarette out of
his mouth and remarked: &ldquo;You can never get that colour with
peroxide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barmaid looked a little suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he means it all right, kid,&rdquo; put in the younger man
quickly. &ldquo;Dicky&rsquo;s one of the serious sort. Besides,
he&rsquo;s in that line; travels for a firm of wholesale
chemists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky nodded gravely. &ldquo;I could see at once it was
natural,&rdquo; he remarked with the air of an expert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;re one of them that keeps their eyes
open,&rdquo; returned the barmaid approvingly, and Dicky modestly
acknowledged the compliment by saying that his business necessitated
close observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most men are as blind as bats,&rdquo; continued the barmaid,
and the examples she gave from her own experience led to an absorbing
conversation, which was presently interrupted by the shriek of the
swing door.</p>
<p>The new-comer was a small, fair man with a neatly waxed moustache.
He came up to the counter with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the air of an habitu&eacute;,
and remarked, &ldquo;Hallo! where&rsquo;s Cis? You&rsquo;re new here,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barmaid, recognizing the marks of a regular customer, quietly
admitted that this was only her second day at the &ldquo;Dun
Taw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away for two months,&rdquo; explained the
fair man, and ordered &ldquo;Scotch.&rdquo; He was evidently in the
mood for company, for he brought up a stool and, sitting a little way
back from the bar, he began to address his three hearers at large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only came back from Europe this evening,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and glad to be home, I assure you.&rdquo; He raised his left
hand with a gesture intended to convey horror, and drank half his
whisky at a gulp.</p>
<p>Dicky turned to give his serious attention to the narrative which
was plainly to follow, and somewhat ostentatiously observed the details
of the new-comer&rsquo;s dress. Dicky had a new-found reputation to
maintain. His friend looked bored and a little sulky, and tried to
continue his conversation with the barmaid, but that young woman,
appreciating the difference in value between a casual and a regular
customer, passed a broad hint by with a smile and said: &ldquo;Europe?
Just fancy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a place to get out of, I assure you,&rdquo; said
the fair man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over there for two
months&mdash;Germany and Austria chiefly&mdash;but for the last
fortnight I&rsquo;ve been wasting my time. There&rsquo;s nothing
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; commented Dicky with great
seriousness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re sick to death of this bally plague,&rdquo;
put in the other young man quickly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been simply
nothing else in the papers for the last I don&rsquo;t know how long. I
want to forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fair man reached forward and put down his empty glass on the bar
counter. &ldquo;Same again, Miss,&rdquo; he said, and then:
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be more sick of the plague before we&rsquo;ve
finished with it. It&rsquo;s a terror. If I was to tell you a few of
the things I&rsquo;ve seen in the past fortnight, I don&rsquo;t suppose
you&rsquo;d believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right; I&rsquo;d believe you quick
enough,&rdquo; returned the young man. &ldquo;Point is, what&rsquo;s
the good of getting yourself in a funk about it? Personally I
don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s coming to England. If it was it would
have been here before this. What I say is &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His pronouncement of opinion ceased abruptly. The fair man&rsquo;s
behaviour riveted attention. He was gazing past the barmaid at the
orderly rows of shining glasses and various shaped bottles behind her.
His mouth was open. He gazed intensely, horribly.</p>
<p>The barmaid backed nervously and looked over her shoulder. The two
young men hastily rose and pushed back their stools. The same thought
was in all their minds. This neat, fair man was on the verge of
delirium tremens.</p>
<p>In a moment the air of intercourse and joviality that had pervaded
the little room was dissipated; in place of it had come shocked
surprise and fear.</p>
<p>There was an interval of slow desolating silence, and then the
convulsive grip of the fair man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"
href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>shattered the glass he held, and
the fragments fell tinkling to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; stammered the barmaid&rsquo;s
admirer, while the barmaid herself shrank back against the shelves and
watched nervously. She had had experience.</p>
<p>The fair man&rsquo;s head was being pulled slowly backwards by some
invisible force. His eyes, staring straight before him, appeared to
watch with fierce intensity some point that moved steadily up the wall
of shelves behind the counter; up till it reached the ceiling and began
to move over the ceiling toward him.</p>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, the horrible tension was relaxed; his head
fell loosely forward and he clapped both hands to the nape of his neck.
He was breathing loudly in short quick gasps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, do you think he&rsquo;s ill?&rdquo; asked the young
man. At the suggestion Dicky made a step towards the sufferer; his
knowledge of chemistry gave him a professional air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s come from Europe&#8202;&hellip;. Suppose
it&rsquo;s the plague,&rdquo; whispered the barmaid.</p>
<p>And at that the two young men started back. As the words were spoken
realization swept upon them.</p>
<p>Mumbling something about &ldquo;get a doctor,&rdquo; they rushed for
the door. One of them made a wide d&eacute;tour&mdash;he had to pass
the man who sat doubled forward in his chair, frantically gripping the
base of his skull.</p>
<p>Hardly had the clatter of the swing door subsided before he fell
forward on to the floor. He was groaning now, groaning detestably.</p>
<p>The barmaid whimpered and stared. &ldquo;Women <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; she said aloud. But she
kept to her own side of the counter.</p>
<p>Later the owner of the &ldquo;Dun Taw&rdquo; identified the fair
man&mdash;from a distance&mdash;as Mr Stewart, of the firm of Barker
and Prince.</p>

<p class="first">Thrale&rsquo;s &ldquo;higher forces&rdquo; had shown
their hand.</p>
<p>The humble and rotund instrument of their choice had served his
purpose, and he was probably the first man in London to receive the
news&mdash;a delicate acknowledgment, perhaps, of his services.</p>
<p>The telegram was addressed to the firm, but as neither of the heads
of the house had arrived, Gosling opened it according to precedent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; was his sole exclamation, but the tone of it
stirred the interest of Flack, who turned to see his colleague&rsquo;s
rather protuberant blue eyes staring with a fishy glare at a flimsy
sheet of paper which visibly trembled in the hold of two clusters of
fat fingers.</p>
<p>Flack lifted his spectacles and holding them on a level with his
eyebrows, said, &ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling sat down, and in the fever of the moment wiped his forehead
with his snuff handkerchief, then discovered his mistake and laid the
handkerchief carelessly on the desk. This infringement of his
invariable practice produced even more effect upon Flack than the
staring eyes and wavering fingers. Gosling might be guilty of mild
histrionics, but not of such a touch as this. The utter neglect of
decency <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>exhibited by the display of that shameful bandanna
could only portend calamity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s sakes, man, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
asked Flack, still taking an observation under his spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come, Flack,&rdquo; said Gosling feebly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Scotland. Our Mr Stewart died of it in Dundee this
mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flack rose from his seat and grabbed the telegram, which was brief
and pregnant. &ldquo;Stewart died suddenly five a.m. Feared plague.
Macfie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tchah!&rdquo; said Flack, still staring at the telegram.
&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<i>Feared</i> plague.&rsquo; Lost their
&rsquo;eads, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve done. Pull yourself
together, man. I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling swallowed elaborately, discovered his bandanna on the desk
and hastily pocketed it. &ldquo;Might &rsquo;a been
&rsquo;eart-disease, d&rsquo;you think?&rdquo; he said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-el,&rdquo; remarked Flack, &ldquo;I never &rsquo;eard as
&rsquo;is &rsquo;eart was affected, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling held out his hand for the telegram, and made a further
elaborate study of it, without, however, discovering any hitherto
unsuspected evidence relating to the unsoundness of Stewart&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says &lsquo;feared,&rsquo; of course,&rdquo; he remarked
at last. &ldquo;Macfie wouldn&rsquo;t have said feared if
&rsquo;e&rsquo;d been sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d &rsquo;ardly have mentioned plague in a telegram
if they &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t been pretty certain, though,&rdquo; argued
Flack.</p>
<p>Gosling was so upset that he had to go out and get a nip of brandy,
a thing he had not done since the morning after Blanche was born.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=

<p>The partners looked grave when they heard the news from Dundee, and
London generally looked very grave indeed, when they read the full
details an hour later in the <i>Evening Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>Stewart, it appeared, had come straight through from Berlin to
London via Flushing and Port Victoria, and on landing in England he had
managed to escape quarantine. His was not an isolated case. For some
weeks it had been possible for British subjects to get past the
officials. There was nothing in the regulations to allow such an
evasion of the order, but it could be managed occasionally. Stewart had
been told to spare no expense.</p>
<p>The <i>Evening Chronicle</i>, although it made the most of its
opportunity in contents bill and headlines, said that there was no
cause for alarm, that these things were managed better in Great Britain
than on the Continent; that the case had been isolated from the first
moment the plague was recognized (about five hours before death), that
the body had been burned, and that the most extensive and elaborate
process of disinfection was being carried out&mdash;even the sleeping
coach in which Stewart had travelled from London to Dundee twelve hours
before, had been identified and burned also.</p>
<p>London still looked grave, but was nevertheless a little inclined to
congratulate itself on the thoroughness of British methods.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get it in England, you see if we do,&rdquo;
was the remark chiefly in vogue among the great Gosling family.</p>
<p>But twelve hours or so too late, England was beginning to regret
that the Government had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>defeated. It was rumoured that the
Premier had broken down, had immediately resigned his office, and would
not seek re-election as a private member.</p>
<p>This rumour was definitely confirmed in the later editions of the
evening papers. Mr Brampton had been summoned to Buckingham Palace and
was forming a temporary ministry which was to take office. In the
circumstances it was deemed inadvisable to plunge the country into a
general election at that moment.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mr Stewart died in the small hours of Friday morning,
and the next day, Saturday, the 14th of April, was the first day of
panic.</p>
<p>The day began with comparative quiet. No further case had been
notified in Great Britain, but telegraphic communication was
interrupted between London and Russia, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, and
other continental centres. In Germany matters were growing desperate.
There had been riots and looting. Military law had been declared in
several towns; in some cases the mob had been fired upon. Business was
at a standstill, and the plague was spreading like a fire. Between two
and three hundred cases were reported from Reims, and upwards of fifty
from Paris&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Business houses were being closed in the City of London, and the
banks noted a marked tendency among their depositors to withdraw gold;
so marked, indeed, that many banks of high standing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>were
glad to be able to close their doors at one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>It was on this Saturday morning, also, that the bottom suddenly fell
out of the money market. For weeks past, prices had been falling
steadily, but now they dropped to panic figures. Every one was selling,
there were no buyers left. Consols were quoted at 53&ndash;1/2.</p>
<p>The air of London was heavy with foreboding, and throughout the
morning the gloom grew deeper. The depressed and worried faces to be
met at every turn contrasted strangely with the brilliance of the
weather. For April had come with clear skies and soft, warm winds.</p>
<p>As the day advanced the atmosphere of depression became continually
more marked, and how extraordinary was the effect upon all classes may
be judged from the fact that less than 5,000 people paid to witness the
third replay between Barnsley and Everton, in the semi-final of the
English cup&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>In London, men and women hung aimlessly about the streets waiting
for the news they dreaded to hear. The theatres were deserted. The
feeling of gloom was so real that many women afterwards believed that
the sky had been overcast, whereas Nature was in one of her most
brilliant moods.</p>
<p>It was a few minutes past three when the pressure was exploded by
the report of the final catastrophe. &ldquo;Two more cases of plague in
Dundee and one in Edinburgh,&rdquo; was the first announcement. That
would have been enough to show that all the vaunted precautions had
been useless, and within <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=
"#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>an hour came the notification of two
further cases. Before six o&rsquo;clock, eight more were notified in
Dundee, three more in Edinburgh, and one in Newcastle.</p>
<p>The new plague had reached England. It was then that the panic
began. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=

<p class="first">Gurney, when he left his office on that Saturday, was
influenced by the general depression. He went to lunch at the
&ldquo;White Vine,&rdquo; in the Haymarket, quite determined to keep
himself in hand, to argue himself out of his low spirits.</p>
<p>He made a beginning at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one seems to have a fit of the blues. Ernst,&rdquo; he
remarked to the waiter with a factitious cheerfulness.</p>
<p>Ernst, less polite than usual, shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;There
is enough cause already,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had bad news from Germany?&rdquo; asked Gurney,
feeling that he had probably been rather brutal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="de">Ach Gott! &rsquo;s&rsquo;ist bald Keiner mehr
da</span>,&rdquo; blubbered Ernst, and he wept without restraint as he
arranged the table, occasionally wiping his eyes with his napkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m most awfully sorry,&rdquo; murmured the embarrassed
Gurney, and retreated behind the horror of his evening paper. He found
small cause for rejoicing there, however, and discarded it as soon as
his lunch had been brought by the red-eyed Ernst. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Mark Tapley would have done,&rdquo; Gurney
reflected moodily as he attacked his chop.</p>
<p>There were few other people in the restaurant, and they were all
silent and engrossed. That dreadful cloud hung over England, the spirit
of pestilence threatened to take substance, the air was full of horror
that might at any moment become a visible shape of destruction.</p>
<p>Gurney did not finish his lunch, he lighted a cigarette, left four
shillings on the table, and hurried out into the air.</p>
<p>He did not look up at the sky as he turned eastwards towards Fleet
Street; no one looked up at the sky that afternoon. Heads and shoulders
were burdened by an invisible weight which kept all eyes on the
ground.</p>
<p>Fleet Street was full of people who crowded round the windows of
newspaper offices, not with the eagerness of a general election crowd,
but with a subdued surliness which ever and again broke out in spurts
of violent temper.</p>
<p>Gurney, still struggling to maintain his composure, found himself
unreasonably irritated when a motor-bus driver shouted at him to get
out of the way. It seemed to Gurney that to be knocked down and run
over was preferable to being shouted at. The noise of those infernal
buses was unbearable, so, also, was that dreadful patter of feet upon
the pavement and the dull murmur of mournful voices. Why, in the name
of God, could not people keep quiet?</p>
<p>He bumped into some one on the pavement as he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>scrambled out of the way of the bus, and the man
swore at him viciously. Gurney responded, and then discovered that the
man was known to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; responded the other.</p>
<p>For a moment they stood awkwardly, staring; then Gurney said,
&ldquo;Any more news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, who was a sub-editor of the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>,
shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going back now,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There was nothing ten minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty awful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; remarked Gurney.</p>
<p>The sub-editor shrugged his shoulders and hurried away.</p>
<p>Presently Gurney found himself wedged among the crowd, watching the
<i>Daily Chronicle</i> window.</p>
<p>A few minutes after three, a young man with a very white face,
fastened a type-written message to the glass.</p>
<p>There was a rapid constriction of the crowd. Those behind, Gurney
among them, could not read the message, and pressed forward. There were
cries of &ldquo;What is it?&hellip; I can&rsquo;t see&#8202;&hellip;.
Read it out&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; Then those in front gave way
slightly, a wave of eagerness agitated the mass of watchers, and the
news ran back from the front. &ldquo;Two more cases of plague in
Dundee; one in Edinburgh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the pressure of dread was suddenly dissipated, giving
place to something kinetic, dynamic. Now it was fear that took the
people by the throat: active, compelling fear. Men looked at each other
with terror and something of hate in their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>eyes,
the crowd broke and melted. Every man was going to his own home,
possessed by an instinct to fly before it was too late.</p>
<p>Gurney shouldered his way out, and stopped a taxi that was crawling
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jermyn Street,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The driver leaned over and pointed to the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>
window. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plague&rsquo;s in Dundee and Edinburgh,&rdquo; said
Gurney, and climbed into the cab and slammed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gawd!&rdquo; muttered the driver, as he drove recklessly
westwards.</p>
<p>Sitting in the cab, finding some comfort in the feeling of headlong
speed, Gurney was debating whether he would not charter the man to take
him right out of London. But he must go home first for money.</p>
<p>At the door of the house in Jermyn Street he met Jasper Thrale.</p>
</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Have you heard?&rdquo; asked Gurney
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo; said Thrale, without interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two more cases in Dundee and one in
Edinburgh,&rdquo; said Gurney. The driver of the cab got down from his
seat, and looked from Gurney to Thrale with doubt and question.</p>
<p>Thrale nodded his head. &ldquo;I knew it was sure to come,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get out of this,&rdquo; put in the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, rather,&rdquo; agreed Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Thrale. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale laughed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have it in America before you
get there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll go there via Japan and
&rsquo;Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know a lot about it,&rdquo; said the driver of
the cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me there&rsquo;s nowhere we can go
to?&rdquo; persisted Gurney.</p>
<p>Thrale smiled. &ldquo;Nowhere in this world,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;This plague has come to destroy mankind.&rdquo; He spoke with a
quiet assurance that carried conviction.</p>
<p>The driver of the cab scowled. &ldquo;May as well &rsquo;ave a run
for my money first, then,&rdquo; he said, and thus gave utterance to
the thought that was fermenting in many other minds.</p>
<p>There was no hope of escape for the mass, only the rich could seek
railway termini and take train for Liverpool, Southampton or any port
where there was the least hope of finding some ship to take them out of
Europe.</p>
<p>That night there was panic and riot. The wealthy classes were trying
to escape, the mob was trying to &ldquo;get a run for its money.&rdquo;
Yet very little real mischief was done. Two or three companies of
infantry were sufficient to clear the streets, and not more than forty
people in all were seriously injured&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>In Downing Street the new Premier sat alone with his head in his
hands, and wondered what could be done to stop the approach of the
pestilence. One of the evening papers had suggested that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>a great
line of fire should be built across the north of England. The Premier
wondered whether that scheme were feasible. He had never held high
office before; he did not know how to deal with these great issues. All
his political life he had learned only the art of party tactics. He had
learned that art very well, he was a master of debate, and he had shown
a wonderful ability to judge the bent of the public mind and to make
use of his judgments for party ends. But now that any action of his was
divorced from its accustomed object, he was as a man suddenly forced
into some new occupation. Whenever he tried to think of some means to
stay the progress of the plague his mind automatically began to
consider what influence the adoption of such means would have upon the
general election which must soon come&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A line of fire across the north,&rdquo; he was thinking,
&ldquo;would shut off the whole of Scotland. They would never forgive
us for that. We should lose the entire Scottish vote&mdash;it&rsquo;s
bad enough as it is.&rdquo; He sat up late into the night considering
what policy he should put before the Cabinet. He tried honestly to
consider the position apart from politics, but his mind refused to work
in that way&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Jermyn Street Thrale was arguing with Gurney,
trying to persuade him into a philosophic attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to be done
but sit down and wait,&rdquo; said Gurney. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; returned Thrale, &ldquo;I have no
intention of spending my time flying from country to country like a
marked criminal. That way leads to insanity. I&rsquo;ve seen men become
animals before now under the influence of fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, you&rsquo;re quite right,&rdquo; agreed
Gurney. &ldquo;One must exercise self-control. After all, it&rsquo;s
only death, and not such a terrible death at that.&rdquo; He got up and
began to pace the room restlessly, then went to the window and looked
out. Jermyn Street was almost deserted, but distant sounds of shouting
came from the direction of Piccadilly. He left the window open and
turned back into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so infernally hard just to sit still and
wait,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If only one could do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt, now,&rdquo; said Thrale, quietly, &ldquo;whether one
could ever have done anything. The public and the Government took my
warnings in the characteristic way, the only possible way in which you
could expect twentieth-century humanity to take a warning&mdash;a
thrill of fear, perhaps, in some cases; frank incredulity in others;
but no result either way that endured for an hour&#8202;&hellip;.
Belief in national and personal security, inertia outside the routine
of necessary, stereotyped employment; these things are essential to the
running of the machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are,&rdquo; agreed Gurney absently He had sat
down again and was sucking automatically at an extinguished pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a complex civilization,&rdquo; went on Thrale &ldquo;any
initiative on the part of the individual outside <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>his own
tiny sphere of energy is just so much grit in the machine. There are
recognized methods, they may not be the best, the most efficient, but
they are accepted and understood. Every clerk who has to calculate
twelve pence to the shilling knows how his work would be lightened if
he had only to calculate ten, but he accepts that difficulty, because
he can do nothing as an individual to introduce the decimal system. And
that spirit of acceptance grows upon him until the individual has the
characteristics of the class. Only when a man is stirred by too great
discomfort does he open his eyes to the possibility of initiative; then
come labour strikes. If labour had a sufficiency of ease and comfort,
if its lot were not so violently contrasted with that of even the
middle-classes, labour would settle down to complacency. But the
contrast is too great, and to attain that complacency of uninitiative
we must level down. That was coming; that would have come if this
plague&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Gurney excitedly, jumping to his
feet. &ldquo;Did you hear firing?&rdquo; He went to the window again,
and leaned out. From Piccadilly came the sound of an army of trampling
feet, of confused cries and shouting. &ldquo;By God, there&rsquo;s a
riot,&rdquo; exclaimed Gurney. He spoke over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Thrale joined him at the window. &ldquo;Panic,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Senseless, hysterical panic. It won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall go out of London,&rdquo; said Gurney.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner &hellip; I&rsquo;d sooner die in the country, I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>think.&rdquo; He withdrew from the window and
began to pace up and down the room again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to stampede with the rest of &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked
Thrale. &ldquo;Extraordinarily infectious thing, panic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that exactly &hellip;&rdquo;
hesitated Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Animal fear,&rdquo; said Thrale. &ldquo;The terror of the
wild thing threatened with the unknown. The runaway horse terrified and
rushing to its own destruction. Fly, fly, fly from the threat of peril
as you did once on the prairies, when to fly meant safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so infernally depressing in London,&rdquo; said
Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, go and brood on death in the country,&rdquo;
replied Thrale. &ldquo;That may cheer you up a bit. But, take my
advice, don&rsquo;t run. Walk at a snail&rsquo;s pace and check the
least tendency to hurry. Once you begin to quicken your pace, you will
find yourself hurrying desperately&mdash;and then stampede the hell of
terror at your heels. After all, you know, you may survive. It
isn&rsquo;t likely that every man will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gurney caught eagerly at that. &ldquo;No, no, of course it
isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t one be much more
likely to survive if one were living in the country, or by the
sea&mdash;in some fairly isolated place, for example. I meant to go
down to Cornwall for my holiday this year, to a little cottage on the
coast about four miles from Padstow; don&rsquo;t you think in pure air
and healthy surroundings like that, one would stand a better
chance?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Thrale carelessly. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t run. In any case you&rsquo;d better wait till the middle of
the week. The first rush will be over then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Perhaps. I&rsquo;ll go on Wednesday, or
Tuesday&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale smiled grimly. &ldquo;Well, good night,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had gone, Gurney went to the window again. The sounds of
riot from Piccadilly had died down to a low, confused murmur. A
motor-car whizzed by along Jermyn Street, and two people passed on
foot, a man and a woman; the woman was leaning heavily on the
man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Gurney turned once more to his pacing of the room. He was trying to
realize the unrealizable fact that the world offered no refuge. For a
full hour he struggled with himself, with that new, strange instinct
which rose up and urged him to fly for his life. At last weary and
overborne he threw himself into a chair by the dying fire and began to
cry like a lost child; even as Ernst, the waiter, had
cried&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

<p class="first">The panic emigration lasted until Monday evening, and
then came news which checked and stayed the rush for the ports of
Liverpool, Southampton and Queenstown. The plague was already in
America. It had come, as Thrale had prophesied from the West. At the
docks many of those favoured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>emigrants who had secured berths,
hesitated; if it was to be a choice between death in America and death
in England, they preferred to die at home.</p>
<p>Yet, even on Tuesday morning, when doubt as to the coming of the
plague was no longer possible, when Dundee could only give approximate
figures of the seizures in that town, reporting them as not less than a
thousand, when it was evident that the whole of Scotland was becoming
infected with incredible rapidity, and two cases were notified as far
south as Durham, there remained still an enormous body of people who
stoutly maintained that, bad as things were, the danger was grossly
exaggerated, who believed that the danger would soon pass, and who,
steadfast to the habits of a lifetime, continued their routine wherever
it was possible so to do, determined to resist to the last.</p>
<p>To this body, possibly some two-fifths of the whole urban
population, was due the comparative maintenance of law and order. In
face of the growing destitution due to the wholesale closing of
factories, warehouses and offices, necessitated by the now complete
cessation of foreign trade and to the hoarding of food stores and gold
which was already so marked as to have seriously affected the commerce
not dependent on foreign sellers and buyers, a semblance of ordinary
life was still maintained. Newspapers were issued, trains and
&rsquo;buses were running, theatres and music-halls were open, and many
normal occupations were carried on.</p>
<p>Yet everything was infected. It was as if the cloak of civilization
was worn more loosely. Crime was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>increasing and justice was
relaxed. Robberies of food were so common that there was no place for
the confinement of those who were convicted. Shopkeepers were becoming
at once more reliant upon their own defences, and less scrupulous in
their dealings with bona-fide customers. No longer could the protection
of the State be exclusively relied upon, the citizen was becoming lost
in the individual. Public opinion was being resolved into individual
opinion; and with the failing of the great restraint every man was
developing an unsuspected side of his character. Thrown upon his own
resources, he became continually less civilized, more conscious of
possibilities to fulfill long-thwarted tendencies and desires; he began
to understand that when it is a case of <i lang="fr">sauve qui
peut</i>, the weakest are trampled under foot.</p>
<p>So the cloak of civilization gaped and showed the form of the naked
man, with all its blemishes and deformities. And women blenched and
shuddered. For woman, as yet, was little, if at all, altered in
character by the fear that was brutalizing man. Her faith in the
intrinsic rectitude of the beloved conventions was more deeply rooted.
Moreover woman fears the strictures of woman, more than man fears the
judgments of man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"

CORNWALL</h2>

<p class="first">Gurney&rsquo;s alternative to flying from the plague
was to run away from himself. He shirked the issue in his conversations
with Thrale, shuffled, sophisticated, and in a futile endeavour to
convince his companion, convinced himself that his reasoning was sound
and his motive unprejudiced.</p>
<p>It was not until the following Thursday, however, that he took train
to Cornwall. He had succeeded in realizing between two and three
hundred pounds in gold, and this he took with him. He intended to lay
in stores of flour, sugar and other primary necessities; to buy and
keep two or three cows, to rear chickens, to grow as much garden
produce as possible, especially potatoes; and generally to provide
against the coming scarcity of food and the cessation of transport.</p>
<p>The bungalow on the shores of Constantine Bay, to which he departed,
was a place well suited to the carrying out of these prudent
arrangements. It belonged to a friend of his, who was rich enough to
indulge his whims, and who had spent a considerable sum of money in
building the place and enclosing ground, but who rarely occupied the
bungalow himself, and was too careless to bother about letting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>it. Gurney had the keys in his possession. When he
had asked his friend for permission to spend his summer holiday there,
he had been told to use the place as if it were his own. &ldquo;Jolly
good thing for me, you know,&rdquo; his friend had said. &ldquo;Keep it
dry and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gurney was not an idle man. Arrived at his bungalow, he lost no time
in carrying out the arrangements he had schemed, and for nearly three
weeks he was so absorbed in this work, in learning new occupations and
perfecting his plan, that he did, indeed, achieve his purpose of
running away from himself.</p>
<p>He became imbued with a new feeling of security; he received neither
letters nor papers from the outside, and the old labourer who assisted
him in setting potatoes, who taught him to milk a cow and instructed
him generally in the primitive arts of self-supporting toil, seemed to
regard all rumours of the new plague which filtered through to the
village of St Merryn as some foreign nonsense which had little bearing
on life in the county of Cornwall, as represented by the twenty-five or
thirty square miles which were to him all the essential world.</p>
<p>Gurney began to believe that the plague would never cross the Tamar,
and one day in early May, when his provisions against a siege were
practically completed, he was stirred to attempt a journey across the
peninsula in order to visit an acquaintance in East Looe. Gurney had
become conscious of a longing for some companionship. Old Hawken was
very good at cows and potatoes, but he was rather deaf and his range of
ideas was severely restricted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From Padstow to Looe is not an ideal journey by rail
at the best of times, involving as it does, a change of train at
Wadebridge, Bodmin Road and Liskeard; but Gurney was in no hurry, and
the conversations he overheard in his compartment were not destructive
of his new-found complacency. There was, indeed, some mention of the
plague, but only in relation to the scarcity of food supply and its
effect on trade. One passenger, very obviously a farmer, was
congratulating himself that he was getting higher prices for stock than
he had ever known, and that as luck would have it he had sown an
unusual number of acres with wheat that year. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
gettun sixty or seventy a quarter, sure &rsquo;nough,&rdquo; he
boasted.</p>
<p>Dickenson&mdash;Gurney&rsquo;s friend in Looe&mdash;regarded the
matter more seriously, but he, too, seemed untouched by any fear of
personal infection. He was an ardent Liberal, and his chief cause for
concern seemed to be that the plague should have come at a time when so
much progress was being made with legislation. He was, also, very
distressed at the reports of poverty and starvation which abounded, and
at the terrible blow to trade generally. But he seemed hopeful that the
trouble would pass and be followed by a new era of enlightened
government, founded on sound Liberal principles.</p>
<p>Gurney stayed the night and the greater part of the next day at
Looe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On his return journey he had to wait at Liskeard to
pick up the main line train for London, which would take him to Bodmin
Road.</p>
<p>It was a glorious May evening. The day had been hot, but now there
was a cool breeze from the sea, and the long shadow from the high bank
of the cutting enwrapped the whole station in a pleasant twilight.</p>
<p>Gurney, deliberately pacing the length of the platform, was
conscious of physical vigour and a great enjoyment of life. He had an
imaginative temperament, and in his moments of exaltation he found the
world both interesting and beautiful, an entirely desirable setting for
the essential Gurney.</p>
<p>So he strolled up and down the platform, regarded any female figure
with interest, and was in no way concerned that the train was already
an hour late. He had expected it to be late. His own train from Looe,
for no particular reason, had been half an hour late. If he missed his
connexion at Wadebridge he would only have some seven or eight miles to
walk.</p>
<p>Fifteen or twenty other people were waiting on the down platform,
and presently Gurney became conscious that his fellow-passengers were
no longer detached into parties of two and three, but were collected in
groups, discussing, apparently, some matter of peculiar interest.</p>
<p>Gurney had been lost in his dreams and had hardly noticed the
passage of time. He looked at his watch <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>and found that the train
was now two hours overdue. The sun had set, but there was still light
in the sky. A man detached himself from one of the groups and Gurney
approached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hours late,&rdquo; he remarked by way of introducing
himself, and looked at his watch again.</p>
<p>The man nodded emphatically. &ldquo;Funny thing is,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that they&rsquo;ve had no information at the office. The
stationmaster generally gets advice when the train leaves
Plymouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lord,&rdquo; said Gurney. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that
the train hasn&rsquo;t got to Plymouth yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;They say
it&rsquo;s the plague. It&rsquo;s dreadfully bad in London, they tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean it&rsquo;s possible the train won&rsquo;t
come in at all?&rdquo; asked Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I should hardly think that,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;Oh, no, I should hardly think that, but goodness knows when it
will come. Very awkward for me. I want to get to St Ives. It&rsquo;s a
long way from here. Have you far to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padstow,&rdquo; said Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padstow!&rdquo; echoed the stranger. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
good step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further than I want to walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say. Thirty miles or so, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that,&rdquo; agreed Gurney. &ldquo;I wonder where one
could get any information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very awkward,&rdquo; was all the help the stranger
had to offer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>Gurney crossed the line and invaded the stationmaster&rsquo;s
office. &ldquo;Sorry to trouble you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but do you
think this train&rsquo;s been taken off, for any reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t been taken off,&rdquo; said the
stationmaster with a wounded air. &ldquo;It may be a bit
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gurney smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something over two hours behind
now, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp it, can I?&rdquo; asked the
stationmaster. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to &rsquo;ave
patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had no advice yet from Plymouth?&rdquo;
persisted Gurney, facing the other&rsquo;s ill-temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t; something&rsquo;s gone wrong with
the wire. We can&rsquo;t get no answer,&rdquo; returned the
stationmaster. &ldquo;Now, if you please, I &rsquo;ave my work to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gurney returned to the down platform and joined a group of men,
among whom he recognized the man he had spoken to a few minutes
before.</p>
<p>The afterglow was dying out of the sky, in the south-west a faint
young moon was setting behind the high bank of the cutting. A porter
had lighted the station lamps, but they were not turned full on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stationmaster tells me that something has gone wrong with
the telegraphic communication,&rdquo; said Gurney, addressing the
little knot of passengers collectively. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get any
answer it seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been an accident likely,&rdquo; suggested some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the engine-driver&rsquo;s got the plague,&rdquo; said
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have put another man on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they could find one.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If we ain&rsquo;t careful we shall be gettin&rsquo; the
plague down &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all why not? The horrible suggestion sprang up in
Gurney&rsquo;s mind with new force. That remote city seemed suddenly
near. He saw in imagination the train leaving Paddington, and only a
journey of six or seven hours divided that departure from its arrival
at Liskeard. It might come in at any moment, bearing the awful
infection. Why should he wait? There was an inn near the station. He
might find a conveyance there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constantine Bay?&rdquo; questioned the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s near St Merryn,&rdquo; said Gurney, but still the
landlord shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not far from Padstow,&rdquo; explained Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pard-stow!&rdquo; exclaimed the landlord on a rising note.
&ldquo;Drive over to Pard-stow at this time o&rsquo; night?&rdquo; He
appeared to think that Gurney was joking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bodmin, then,&rdquo; suggested Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, why not take the train?&rdquo; asked the landlord.</p>
<p>Gurney shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;The train doesn&rsquo;t seem
to be coming,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad job, that,&rdquo; answered the landlord. &ldquo;Been an
accident, sure &rsquo;nough; this new plague or something.&rdquo; He
was evidently prepared to accept the matter philosophically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t drive me then?&rdquo; asked Gurney.</p>
<p>The landlord shook his head with a grin. He was inclined to look
upon this foreigner as rather more foolish than the majority of his
kind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>Gurney came out of the little inn, and looked down into the station.
The number of waiting passengers seemed to be decreasing, but the light
was so dim that he could not see into the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must keep hold of myself,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;I
mustn&rsquo;t run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man was coming up the steep incline towards him, and Gurney moved
slowly to meet him. He found that it was the stranger he had spoken to
on the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; asked Gurney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve got a message through from
Saltash,<span class="corr" id="xd26e1771" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> replied the stranger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the plague right enough. They say they don&rsquo;t know when
there&rsquo;ll be another train&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Days grew into weeks, and still there were no trains.
Trade was at a standstill, and the prices of home produce mounted
steadily. Fish there was, but not in great abundance, and the towns
inland, such as Truro and Bodmin, organized a motor service with coast
fishing villages, a service which only lasted for a week, by reason of
the failure of the petrol supply. After that there was a less effective
horse service.</p>
<p>Within three weeks after that last train arrived from outside, a new
system of exchange was coming into vogue. In this little congeries of
communities in Cornwall, men were beginning to learn the uselessness of
gold, silver and bronze coins as tokens. Credit had collapsed, and a
system of barter was being introduced, mainly between farmer and
fisherman. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=

become a self-supporting community, for its proportionately few
inhabitants were rapidly being depleted by want and starvation; but,
although it was the last place in the British Isles to become infected,
the plague came there, too, in the end.</p>
<p>A steamer sent out from Cardiff on a plundering expedition carried
the plague to the Scillies, and a fishing vessel from St Ives carried
it on to Newlyn&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"

GEORGE GOSLING</h2>

<h3 class="main">1</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The progress of the plague through London and the
world in general was marked, in the earlier stages, by much the same
developments as are reported of the plague of 1665. The closed houses,
the burial pits, the deserted streets, the outbreaks of every kind of
excess, the various symptoms of fear, cowardice, fortitude and courage,
evidenced little change in the average of humanity between the
seventeenth and the twentieth centuries. The most notable difference
during these earlier stages was in the enormously increased rapidity
with which the population of London was reduced to starvation point.
Even before the plague had reached England, want had become general, so
general, indeed, as to have demonstrated very clearly the truth of the
great economist&rsquo;s contention that England could not exist for
three months with closed doors.</p>
<p>The coming of the plague threw London on to its own very limited
resources. That vast city, which produced nothing but the tokens of
wealth, and added nothing to the essentials that support life, was
instantly reduced to the state of Paris in the winter of 1870&ndash;71;
with the difference, however, that London&rsquo;s population could be
decreased rapidly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99"
name="pb99">99</a>]</span>by emigration, and was, also, even more
rapidly decreased by pestilence. Yet there was a large section of the
population which clung with blind obstinacy to the only life it knew
how to live.</p>
<p>There was, for instance, George Gosling, more fortunate in many
respects than the average citizen, who clung desperately to his house
in Wisteria Grove until forced out of it by the lack of water.</p>
<p>On the ninth day after the first coming of the plague to
London&mdash;it appeared simultaneously in a dozen places and spread
with fearful rapidity&mdash;Gosling broke one of the great laws he had
hitherto observed with such admirable prudence. The offices and
warehouse in Barbican had been shut up (temporarily, it was supposed),
and the partners had disappeared from London. But Gosling had a
duplicate set of keys, and, inspired by the urgency of his
family&rsquo;s need, he determined to dare a journey into the City in
order to <i>borrow</i> (he laid great stress on the word) a few
necessaries of life from the well-stored warehouse of his firm.</p>
<p>In this scheme, planned with some shrewdness, he co-operated with a
friend, a fellow-sidesman at the Church of St John the Evangelist. This
friend was a coal merchant, and thus fortunately circumstanced in the
possession of wagons and horses.</p>
<p>These two arranged the details of their borrowing expedition between
them. Economically, it was a deal on the lines of the revived methods
of exchange and barter. Gosling was willing to exchange certain
advantages of knowledge and possession for the hire of wagons and
horses. It was decided, for obvious <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>reasons, to admit no
other conspirator into the plot, and Boost, the coal merchant, drove
one cart and Gosling drove the other. Perhaps it should rather be said
that he led the other, for, after a preliminary trial, he decided that
he was safer at the horses&rsquo; heads than behind their tails.</p>
<p>The raid was conducted with perfect success. Boost had a head for
essentials. The invaluable loads of tinned meats, fruits and vegetables
were screened by tarpaulins from the possibly too envious eyes of
hungry passers-by&mdash;quite a number of vagrants were to be seen in
the streets on that day&mdash;and Boost and Gosling, disguised in
coal-begrimed garments, made the return journey lugubriously calling,
&ldquo;Plague, plague,&rdquo; the cry of the drivers of the funeral
carts which had even then become necessary. Their only checks were the
various applications they received for the cartage of corpses;
applications easily put on one side by pointing to the piled-up
carts&mdash;they had spent six laborious hours in packing them.
&ldquo;No room; no room,&rdquo; they cried, and on that day the
applicants who accosted Boost and Gosling were not the only ones who
had to wait for the disposal of their dead.</p>
<p>Gosling arrived at Wisteria Grove, hot and outwardly jubilant,
albeit with a horrible fear lurking in his mind that he had been in
dangerous proximity to those tendered additions to his load. His booty
was stored in one of the downstairs rooms&mdash;with the assistance of
Mrs Gosling and the two girls they managed the unpacking without
interruption in two hours and a half&mdash;and then, with boarded
windows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>and locked doors, the Goslings sat down to await
the passing of horror.</p>
<p>Boost died of the plague forty-eight hours after the great
adventure, but as he had a wife and four daughters his plunder was not
wasted.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For nearly a fortnight after the raid the Goslings lay
snug in their little house in Wisteria Grove, for they, in company with
the majority of English people at this time, had not yet fully
appreciated the fact that women were almost immune from infection. In
all, not more than eight per cent of the whole female population was
attacked, and of this proportion the mortality was almost exclusively
among women over fifty years of age. When the first faint rumours of
the plague had come to Europe, this curious, almost unprecedented,
immunity of women had been given considerable prominence. It had made
good copy, theories on the subject had appeared, and the point had
aroused more interest than that of the mortality among
males&mdash;infectious diseases were commonplace enough; this new phase
had a certain novelty and piquancy. But the threat of European
infection had overwhelmed the interest in the odd predilection of the
unknown bacterium, and the more vital question had thrown this
peculiarity into the background. Thus the Goslings and most other women
feared attack no less than their husbands, brothers and sons, and found
justification for their fears in the undoubted fact that women had died
of the plague. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Goslings had always jogged along amiably enough; their home life
would have passed muster as a tolerably happy one. The head of the
family was out of the house from 8.15 a.m. to 7.15 p.m. five days of
the week, and it was only occasionally in the evening of some long wet
Sunday that there was any open bickering.</p>
<p>Now, confinement in that little house, aggravated by fear and by the
absence of any interest or diversion coming from outside, showed the
family to one another in new aspects. Before two days had passed the
air was tense with the suppressed irritation of these four people, held
together by scarcely any tie other than that of a conventional
affection.</p>
<p>By the third day the air was so heavily charged that some explosion
was inevitable. It came early in the morning.</p>
<p>Gosling had run out of tobacco, and he thought in the circumstances
that it would be wiser to send Blanche or Millie than to go himself.
So, with an air of exaggerated carelessness, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Millie, my gel, I wish you&rsquo;d just run out
and see if you can get me any terbaccer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; replied Millie, with decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; asked Gosling.</p>
<p>Millie shrugged her shoulders, and called her sister, who was in the
passage. &ldquo;I say, B., father wants us to go out shopping for him.
Are you on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche, duster in hand, appeared at the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he go himself?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied her father, getting very red,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>and speaking with elaborate care,
&ldquo;men&rsquo;s subject to the infection and women is
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all my eye,&rdquo; returned Millie. &ldquo;Lots
of women have got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well known,&rdquo; said Gosling, still keeping
himself in hand, &ldquo;a matter of common knowledge, that women is
comparatively immune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s yarn, that is,&rdquo; said
Blanche, &ldquo;just to save themselves. We all know what men
are&mdash;selfish brutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to fetch me that terbaccer or are you
not?&rdquo; shouted Mr Gosling suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Millie, defiantly. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t safe for girls to go about the streets, let alone the risk
of infection.&rdquo; She had heard her father shout before, and she was
not, as yet, at all intimidated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I say you are!&rdquo; shouted her father.
&ldquo;Lazy, good-for-nothing creatures, the pair of you! &rsquo;Oose
paid for everything you&rsquo;ve eat or drunk or wore ever since you
was born? An&rsquo; now you won&rsquo;t even go an errand.&rdquo; Then,
seeing the ready retort rising to his daughters&rsquo; lips, he grew
desperate, and, advancing a step towards them, he said savagely:
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll find a way to make
yer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a new aspect, and the two girls were a little frightened.
Natural instinct prompted them to scream for their mother.</p>
<p>She had been listening at the top of the stairs, and she answered
the call for help with great promptitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Gosling,&rdquo; she
said, on a high note. &ldquo;The streets isn&rsquo;t safe for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>gels, as you know well enough; and why should my
gels risk their lives for the sake of your nasty, dirty, wasteful
&rsquo;abit of smoking, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling&rsquo;s new-found courage was evaporating at the attack of
this third enemy. He had been incensed against his daughters, but he
had not yet overcome the habit of giving in to his wife, for the sake
of peace. She had managed him very capably for a quarter of a century,
but on the occasions when she had found it necessary to use what she
called the &ldquo;rough side of her tongue&rdquo; she had demonstrated
very clearly which of the two was master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought I might &rsquo;a been allowed a little
terbaccer,&rdquo; he said, resentfully. &ldquo;&rsquo;Oo risked his
life to lay in provisions, I should like to know? An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
a matter o&rsquo; common knowledge as women is immune from this
plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs Carter, three doors off, carried out dead of it the
day before yesterday!&rdquo; remarked Mrs Gosling, triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;ere and there, a case or two,&rdquo; replied her
husband. &ldquo;But not one woman to a thousand men gets it, as every
one knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know I mightn&rsquo;t be the one?&rdquo; asked
Millie, bold now under her mother&rsquo;s protection.</p>
<p>For that morning, the matter remained in abeyance; but Gosling,
muttering and grumbling, nursed his injury and meditated on the fact
that his daughters had been afraid of him. Things were altered now.
There was no convention to tie his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"
href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>hands. He would work himself
into a protective passion and defy the three of them. Also, there was
an unopened bottle of whisky in the sideboard.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he would have put off the trial of his strength if he
had had to seek an opportunity. He was, as yet, too civilized to take
the initiative in cold blood.</p>
<p>The opportunity, however, soon presented itself in that house. The
air had been little cleared by the morning&rsquo;s outbreak, and before
evening the real explosion came. A mere trifle originated it&mdash;a
warning from Gosling that their store of provisions would not last for
ever, and a sharp retort from Millie to the effect that her father did
not stint himself, followed by a reminder from Mrs Gosling that the
raid might be repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, you&rsquo;d be willing enough for <i>me</i> to die
of the plague, I&rsquo;ve no doubt!&rdquo; broke out Gosling.
&ldquo;<i>I</i> can walk six mile to get you pervisions, but you
can&rsquo;t go to the corner of the street for my terbaccer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pervisions is necessary, terbaccer ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Mrs Gosling. She was not a clever woman. She judged this to be the
right opportunity to keep her husband in his place, and relied
implicitly on the quelling power of her tongue. Her intuitions were
those of the woman who had lived all her life in a London suburb; they
did not warn her that she was now dealing with a specimen of
half-decivilized humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; shouted Gosling, getting to his
feet. His face was purple, and his pale blue eyes were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>starting from his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon
show you what&rsquo;s necessary and what ain&rsquo;t, and &rsquo;oose
master in this &rsquo;ouse. And <i>I</i> say terbaccer is necessary,
an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, one o&rsquo; you three&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to fetch it quick! D&rsquo;ye
&rsquo;ear&mdash;one&mdash;o&rsquo;&mdash;you&mdash;three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This inclusion of Mrs Gosling was, indeed, to declare war.</p>
<p>Millie and Blanche screamed and backed, but their mother rose to the
occasion. She did not reserve herself; she began on her top note; but
Gosling did not allow her to finish. He strode over to her and shook
her by the shoulders, shouting to drown her strident recriminations.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Old your tongue! &rsquo;old your tongue!&rdquo; he
bawled, and shook her with increasing violence. He was feeling his
power, and when his wife crumpled up and fell to the floor in shrieking
hysterics, he still strode on to victory. Taking the cowed and
terrified Millie by the arm, he dragged her along the passage, unlocked
and opened the front door and pushed her out into the street.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you come back without my terbaccer!&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; quavered the shrinking Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Alf-a-crown&rsquo;s worth,&rdquo; replied Gosling
fiercely, and tossed the coin down on the little tiled walk that led up
to the front door.</p>
<p>After Millie had gone he stood at the door for a moment, thankful
for the coolness of the air on his heated face. &ldquo;I got to keep
this up,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, with his first thought of
wavering. Behind him he heard the sound of uncontrolled weeping and
little cries of the &ldquo;first time in twenty-four <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>years&rdquo; and &ldquo;what the
neighbours&rsquo;ll think, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neighbours,&rdquo; muttered Gosling, contemptuously,
&ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t any neighbours&mdash;not to count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A distant sound of slow wheels caught his ear. He listened
attentively, and there came to him the remote monotonous chant of a
dull voice crying: &ldquo;Plague! Plague!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped in quickly and closed the door.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Millie found the Kilburn High Road deserted. No
traffic of any kind was to be seen in the street, and the rare
foot-passengers, chiefly women, had all a furtive air. Starvation had
driven them out to raid. No easy matter, as Millie soon found, for all
shutters were down, and in many cases shop-fronts were additionally
protected by great sheets of strong hoarding.</p>
<p>Millie, recovering from her fright, was growing resentful. Her
little conventional mind was greatly occupied by the fact that she was
out in the High Road wearing house-shoes without heels, in an old print
dress, and with no hat to hide the carelessness of her hair-dressing.
At the corner of Wisteria Grove she stopped and tried to remedy this
last defect; she had red hair, abundant and difficult to control.</p>
<p>The sight of the deserted High Road did not inspire her with
self-confidence; she still feared the possibility of meeting some one
who might recognize <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>her. How could one account for one&rsquo;s
presence in a London thoroughfare at seven o&rsquo;clock on a bright
May evening in such attire? Certainly not by telling the truth.</p>
<p>The air was wonderfully clear. Coal was becoming very scarce, and
few fires had been lighted that day to belch forth their burden of
greasy filth into the atmosphere. The sun was sinking, and Millie
instinctively clung to the shadow of the pavement on the west side of
the road. She, too, slunk along with the evasive air that was common to
the few other pedestrians, the majority of them on this same shadowed
pavement. That warm, radiant light on the houses opposite seemed to
hold some horror for them.</p>
<p>So preoccupied was Millie with her resentment that she wandered for
two or three hundred yards up the road without any distinct idea of
what she was seeking. When realization of the futility of her search
came to her, she stopped in the shadow of a doorway. &ldquo;What
<i>is</i> the good of going on?&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;All the shops
are shut up.&rdquo; But the thought of her father in his new aspect of
muscular tyrant intimidated her. She dared not return without
accomplishing her errand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have another look,
anyway,&rdquo; she said; and then: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought he
was such a brute?&rdquo; She rubbed the bruise on her arm; her mouth
was twisted into an ugly expression of spiteful resentment. Her
thoughts were busy with plans of revenge even as she turned to
prosecute her search for the tyrant&rsquo;s tobacco. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>Here and there shops had been forcibly, burglariously entered,
plate-glass windows smashed, and interiors cleared of everything
eatable; the debris showed plainly enough that these rifled shops had
all belonged to grocers or provision merchants. Into each of these
ruins Millie stared curiously, hoping foolishly that she might find
what she sought. She ventured into one and carried away a box of
soap&mdash;they were running short of soap at home. A sense of moving
among accessible riches stirred within her, a desire for further
pillage.</p>
<p>She came at last to a shop where the shutters were still intact, but
the door hung drunkenly on one hinge. A little fearfully she peered in
and discovered that fortune had been kind to her. The shop had belonged
to a tobacconist, and the contents were almost untouched&mdash;there
had been more crying needs to satisfy in the households of raiders than
the desire for tobacco.</p>
<p>It was very dark inside, and for some seconds Millie stared into
what seemed absolute blackness, but as her eyes became accustomed to
the gloom, she saw the interior begin to take outline, and when she
moved a couple of steps into the place and allowed more light to come
in through the doorway, various tins, boxes and packets in the shelves
behind the counter were faintly distinguishable.</p>
<p>Once inside, the spirit of plunder took hold of her, and she began
to take down boxes of cigars and cigarettes and packets of tobacco,
piling them up in a heap on the counter. But she had no basket in which
to carry the accumulation she was making, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>and she was feeling
under the counter for some box into which to put her haul, when the
shadows round her deepened again into almost absolute darkness.
Cautiously she peered up over the counter and saw the silhouette of a
woman standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>For ten breathless seconds Millie hung motionless, her eyes fixed on
the apparition. She was very civilized still, and she was suddenly
conscious of committing a crime. She feared horribly lest the figure in
the doorway might discover Millicent Gosling stealing tobacco. But the
intruder, after recognizing the nature of the shop&rsquo;s contents,
moved away with a sigh. Millie heard her dragging footsteps shuffle
past the window.</p>
<p>That scare decided her movements. She hastily looped up the front of
her skirt, bundled into it as much plunder as she could conveniently
carry, and made her way out into the street again.</p>
<p>She was nearly at the corner of Wisteria Grove before she was
molested, and then an elderly woman came suddenly out of a doorway and
laid a hand on Millie&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whacher got?&rdquo; asked the woman savagely.</p>
<p>Millie, shrinking and terrified, displayed her plunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cigars,&rdquo; muttered the woman. &ldquo;Whacher want with
cigars?&rdquo; She opened the boxes and stirred up the contents of
Millie&rsquo;s improvised bundle in an eager search for something to
eat. &ldquo;Gawd&rsquo;s truth! yer must be crazy, yer thievin&rsquo;
little slut!&rdquo; she grumbled, and pushed the girl fiercely from
her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>Millie made good her escape, dropping a box of cigars in her flight.
Her one thought now was the fear of meeting a policeman. In three
minutes she was beating fiercely on the door of the little house in
Wisteria Grove, and, disregarding her father&rsquo;s exclamations of
pleased surprise when he let her in, she tumbled in a heap on to the
mat in the passage.</p>
<p>Gosling&rsquo;s first declaration of male superiority had been
splendidly successful.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A few minutes after Millie&rsquo;s return, Mrs
Gosling, red-eyed and timidly vicious, interrupted her husband&rsquo;s
perfect enjoyment of the long-desired cigar by the announcement:
&ldquo;The gas is off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling got up, struck a match, and held it to the sitting-room
burner. The match burned steadily. There was no pressure even of air in
the pipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turned off at the meter!&rdquo; snapped Gosling.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, lemme go an&rsquo; see!&rdquo; He spoke with the air
of the superior male, strong in his comprehension of the mechanical
artifices which so perplex the feminine mind. Mrs Gosling sniffed, and
stood aside to let him pass. She had already examined the meter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we got lamps!&rdquo; snarled Gosling when he returned.
He had always preferred a lamp to read by in the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No oil,&rdquo; returned Mrs Gosling, gloomily. She&rsquo;d
teach him to shake her!</p>
<p>Gosling meditated. His parochial mind was full <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>of
indignation. Vague thoughts of &ldquo;getting some one into trouble for
this&rdquo;&mdash;even of that last, desperate act of coercion, writing
to the papers about it&mdash;flitted through his mind. Plainly
something must be done. &ldquo;&rsquo;Aven&rsquo;t you got any
candles?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One or two. They won&rsquo;t last long,&rdquo; replied his
studiously patient partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to use them to-night and go to
bed early,&rdquo; was Gosling&rsquo;s final judgment. His wife left the
room with a shrug of forbearing contempt.</p>
<p>When she had gone, the head of the house went upstairs and peered
out into the street. The sun had set, and an unprecedented mystery of
darkness was falling over London. The globes of the tall electric
standards, catching a last reflection from the fading sky, glimmered
faintly, but were not illuminated from within by any fierce glare of
violet light. Darkness and silence enfolded the great dim organism that
sprawled its vast being over the earth. The spirit of mystery caught
Gosling in its spell. &ldquo;All dark,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;and
quiet! Lord! how still it is!&rdquo; Even in his own house there was
silence. Downstairs, three injured, resentful women were talking in
whispers.</p>
<p>Gosling, still sucking his cigar, stood entranced, peering into the
darkness; he had ventured so far as to throw up the sash.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the stillness of death!&rdquo; he muttered. Then he
cocked his head on one side, for he caught the sound of distant
shouting. Somewhere in the Kilburn Road another raid was in
progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No light,&rdquo; murmured Gosling, &ldquo;and no fire!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>An immediate association suggested itself.
&ldquo;By gosh! and no <i>water</i>!&rdquo; he added. For some seconds
he contemplated with fearful awe the failure of the great essential of
life.</p>
<p>In the cistern room he was reassured by the sound of a delicious
trickle from the ball-cock. &ldquo;Still going,&rdquo; he said to
himself; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to be careful. Surely
they&rsquo;ll keep the water goin&rsquo;, though; whatever
&rsquo;appens, they&rsquo;d surely keep the water on?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nothing but the failure of the water could have driven
them from Wisteria Grove. Half-a-dozen times every day Gosling would
climb up to the top of the house to reassure himself. And at last came
the day when a dreadful silence reigned under the slates, when no
delicious tinkle of water gave promise of maintained security from
water famine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll come on again at night,&rdquo; said Gosling to
himself. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to be careful, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went downstairs and issued orders that no more water was to be
drawn that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must wash up the breakfast things,&rdquo; was his
wife&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t wash up nothing,&rdquo; said Gosling,
&ldquo;not one blessed thing. It&rsquo;s better to go dirty than die
o&rsquo; thirst. Hevery drop o&rsquo; the water in that cistern must be
saved for drinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling noisily put down the kettle she was holding. &ldquo;Oh!
very well, my lord!&rdquo; she remarked, sarcastically. She looked at
her two daughters with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>a twist of her mouth. There were
only two sides in that house; the women were as yet united against the
common foe.</p>
<p>When Gosling, fatuously convinced of his authority, had gone, his
wife quietly filled the kettle and proceeded with her washing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father thinks &rsquo;e knows everything these
days,&rdquo; remarked the mother to her allies.</p>
<p>There was much whispering for some time.</p>
<p>Gosling spent most of the day in the roof, but not until the
afternoon did he realize that the cistern was slowly being emptied. His
first thought was that one of the pipes leaked, his second that it was
time to make a demonstration of force. He found a walking-stick in the
hall&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>But even when that precious half-cistern of water was only called
upon to supply the needs of thirst, and the Goslings, sinking further
into the degradation of savagedom, slunk furtive and filthy about the
gloomy house, it became evident that a move must be made sooner or
later. Two alternatives were presented: they might go north and east to
the Lea, or south to the Thames.</p>
<p>Gosling chose the South. He knew Putney; he had been born there. He
knew nothing of Clapton and its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>So one bright, clear day at the end of May, the Goslings set out on
their great trek. The head of the house, driven desperate by fear of
thirst, raided his late partner&rsquo;s coal sheds and found one living
horse and several dead ones. The living horse was partly revived by
water from an adjacent butt, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>next day it was
harnessed to a coal cart and commandeered to convey the Goslings&rsquo;
provisions to Putney. It died half-a-mile short of their destination,
but they were able, by the exercise of their united strength, to get
the cart and its burden down to the river.</p>
<p>They found an empty house without difficulty, but they had an
unpleasant half-hour in removing what remained of one of the previous
occupants. Gosling hoped it was not a case of plague. As the body was
that of a woman, and terribly emaciated, there were some grounds for
his optimism.</p>
<p>Gosling was in a state of some bewilderment. When water had been
fetched in buckets from the river, and the three women had explored,
criticized and sniffed over their new home somewhat in the manner of
strange cats, the head of the house settled down to a cigar and a
careful consideration of his perplexities.</p>
<p>In the first place, he wondered why those horses of Boost&rsquo;s
had not been used for food; in the second, he wondered why he had not
seen a single man during the whole of the long trek from Brondesbury to
Putney. By degrees an unbelievable explanation presented itself: no men
were left. He remembered that the few needy-looking women he had seen
had looked at him curiously; in retrospect he fancied their regard had
had some quality of amazement. Gosling scratched the bristles of his
ten-days&rsquo;-old beard and smoked thoughtfully. He almost regretted
that he had stared so fiercely and threateningly at every chance woman
they had seen; he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span>might have got some news. But the whole
journey had been conducted in a spirit of fear; they had been defending
their food, their lives; they had been primitive creatures ready to
fight desperately at the smallest provocation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man left,&rdquo; said Gosling to himself, and was not
convinced. If that indeed were the solution of his perplexity, he was
faced with an awful corollary; his own time would come. He thought of
Barbican, E.C., of Flack, of Messrs Barker and Prince, of the office
staff, and the office itself. He had not been able to rid his mind of
the idea that in a few weeks he would be back in the City again. He had
several times rehearsed his surprise when he should be told of the
depredations in the warehouse; he had wondered only yesterday if he
dared go to the office in his beard.</p>
<p>But to-night the change of circumstance, the breaking up of old
associations, was opening his eyes to new horizons. There might never
be an office again for him to go to. If he survived&mdash;and he was
distinctly hopeful on that score&mdash;he might be almost the only man
left in London; there might not be more than a few thousand in the
whole of England, in Europe&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>For a time he dwelt on this fantastic vision. Who would do the work?
What work would there be to do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get food,&rdquo; murmured Gosling, and wondered
vaguely how food was &ldquo;got&rdquo; when there were no shops, no
warehouses, no foreign agents. His mind turned chiefly to meat, since
that had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>been his trade. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ave to rear sheep
and cattle, I suppose,&rdquo; said Gosling. As an afterthought he
added: &ldquo;An&rsquo; grow wheat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed heavily. He realized that he had no knowledge on the
subject of rearing cattle and growing wheat; he also realized that he
was craving for ordinary food again&mdash;milk, eggs, and fresh
vegetables. He had a nasty-looking place on his leg which he rightly
attributed to unwholesome diet.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After forty-eight hours&rsquo; residence in the new
house, Gosling began to pluck up his courage and to dare the perils of
the streets. He was beginning to have faith in his luck, to believe
that the plague had passed away and left him untouched.</p>
<p>And as day succeeded day he ventured further afield; he went in
search of milk, eggs and vegetables, but he only found young nettles,
which he brought home and helped to eat when they had been boiled over
a wood fire. They were all glad to eat nettles, and were the better for
them. Occasionally he met women on these excursions, and stayed to talk
to them. Always they had the same tale to tell&mdash;their men were
dead, and themselves dying of starvation.</p>
<p>One day at the beginning of June he went as far as Petersham, and
there at the door of a farmhouse he saw a fine, tall young woman. She
was such a contrast to the women he usually met on his expeditions that
he paused and regarded her with curiosity. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> want?&rdquo; asked the young woman,
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t any milk or butter or eggs
to sell?&rdquo; asked Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell?&rdquo; echoed the girl, contemptuously. &ldquo;What
&rsquo;ave you got to give us as is worth food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, money,&rdquo; replied Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; came the echo again. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
good of money when there&rsquo;s nothing to buy with it? I
wouldn&rsquo;t sell you eggs at a pound apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling scratched his beard&mdash;it looked quite like a beard by
this time. &ldquo;Rum go, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked, and
smiled.</p>
<p>His new acquaintance looked him up and down, and then smiled in
return, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
the first man I&rsquo;ve seen since father died, a month
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; with you?&rdquo; asked
Gosling, pointing to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother and sister, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ard work for you to get a livin&rsquo;, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, so. We&rsquo;re used to farm-work. The trouble&rsquo;s to
keep the other women off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied Gosling reflectively, and the two looked
at one another again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;ungry?&rdquo; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to speak of,&rdquo; replied Gosling. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
fair pinin&rsquo; for a change o&rsquo; diet. Been livin&rsquo; on
tinned things for five weeks or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in and have an egg,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Gosling, &ldquo;I will, with
pleasure.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"
name="pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>They grew friendly over that meal&mdash;two eggs and a glass of
milk. He ate the eggs with butter, but there was no bread. It seemed
that the young woman&rsquo;s mother and sister were at work on the
farm, but that one of them had always to stay at home and keep
guard.</p>
<p>They discussed the great change that had come over England, and
wondered what would be the end of it; and after a little time, Gosling
began to look at the girl with a new expression in his pale blue
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Hevrything&rsquo;s changed,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be the same any more, as far as we can
see. There&rsquo;s no neighbours now, f&rsquo;rinstance, and no talk of
what&rsquo;s going on&mdash;or anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him thoughtfully. &ldquo;What we miss is some man
to look after the place,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re robbed
terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gosling had not meant to go as far as that. He was not unprepared
for a pleasant flirtation, now that there were no neighbours to report
him at home, but the idea that he could ever separate himself
permanently from his family had not occurred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you want a man about these
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever done any farm work?&rdquo; asked the girl.</p>
<p>Gosling shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d soon learn,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must think it over,&rdquo; said Gosling suddenly.
&ldquo;Shall you be &rsquo;ere to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of us will,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but shall <i>you</i>?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve took a fancy to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said the girl, and
laughed.</p>
<p>Gosling kissed her before he left.</p>

<p class="first">In West Hampstead a Jewess, who had once been fat,
looked out of the windows of her gaudy house. She was partly dressed in
a garish silk neglig&eacute;. Her face was exceedingly dirty, but the
limp, pallid flesh was revealed in those places where she had wiped
away her abundant tears. Her body was bruised and stiff, for in a
recent raid on a house suspected of containing provisions she had been
hardly used by her sister women. She had made the mistake of going out
too well dressed; she had imagined that expensive clothes would command
respect&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>As she looked out she wept again, bewailing her misery. From her
earliest youth she had been pampered and spoilt. She had learnt that
marriage was her sole object in life, and she had sold herself at a
very respectable price. She had received the applause and favour of her
family for marrying the man she had chosen as most likely to provide
her with the luxury which she regarded as her birth-right.</p>
<p>Two days ago she had cooked and eaten the absurdly expensive but
diminutive dog upon which she had lavished the only love of which she
had been capable. She had wept continuously as she ate her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>idol, but for the first time she had regretted
his littleness.</p>
<p>Hunger and thirst were driving her out of the house of which she had
been so vain; the primitive pains were awakening in her primitive
instincts that had never stirred before. From her window she could see
naught but endless streets of brick, stone and asphalt, but beyond that
dry, hot, wilderness she knew there were fields&mdash;she had seen them
out of the corner of her eye when she had motored to Brighton. Fields
had never been associated in her mind with food until the strange new
stirring of that unsuspected instinct. Food for her meant shops. One
went to shops and bought food and bought the best at the lowest price
possible. With all her pride of position, she had never hesitated to
haggle with shopkeepers. And when the first pinch had come, when her
husband had selfishly died of the plague, and her household had
deserted her, it was to the shops she had gone, autocratically
demanding her rights. She had learned by experience now that she had no
longer any rights.</p>
<p>She dressed herself in her least-conspicuous clothes, dabbed her
face with powder to cover some of the dirt&mdash;there was no water,
and in any case she did not feel inclined to wash&mdash;carefully
stowed away all her money and the best of her jewels in a small leather
bag, and set out to find the country where food grew out of the
ground.</p>
<p>Instinct set her face to the north. She took the road towards
Hendon&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=

<p class="first">In every quarter of London, in every great town and
city throughout Europe, women were setting their faces towards the
country.</p>
<p>By the autumn London was empty. The fallen leaves in park squares
and suburban streets were swept into corners by the wind, and when the
rain came the leaves clung together and rotted, and so continued the
long routine of decay and birth.</p>
<p>When spring came again, Nature returned with delicate, strong hands
to claim her own. For hundreds of years she had been defied in the
heart of this great, hard, stone place. Her little tentative efforts
had been rudely repulsed, no tender thread of grass had been allowed to
flourish for an hour under the feet of the crushing multitude. Yet she
had fought with a steady persistence that never relaxed a
moment&rsquo;s effort. Whenever men had given her a moment&rsquo;s
opportunity, even in the very heart of that city of burning struggle,
she had covered the loathed sterility with grass and flowers,
dandelions, charlock, grounsel and other life that men call weeds.</p>
<p>Now, when her full opportunity came, she set to work in her slow,
patient way to wreck and cover the defilement of earth. Her winds swept
dust into every corner, and her rain turned it into a shallow bed of
soil, ready to receive and nurture the tiny seeds that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>sailed on little feathered wings, or were
carried by bird and insect to some quiet refuge in which they might
renew life, and, dying, add fertility to the mother who had brought
them forth.</p>
<p>Nature came, also, with her hurricanes, her lightnings and her
frosts, to rend and destroy. She stripped slates from roofs, thrust out
gables and overturned solid walls. She came with fungi to undermine and
with the seeds of trees to split asunder.</p>
<p>She asked for but a few hundred years of patient, continuous work in
order to make of London once more a garden; where the nightingale might
sing in Oxford Street and the children of a new race pluck sweet wild
flowers over the site of the Bank of England&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

<p class="first">The spirit of London had gone out of her, and her body
was crumbling and rotting. There was no life in all that vast sprawl of
bricks and mortar; the very dogs and cats, deserted by humanity, left
her to seek their only food, to seek those other living things which
were their natural quarry.</p>
<p>In her prime, London had been the chief city of the world. Men and
women spoke of her as an entity, wrote of her as of a personality,
loved her as a friend. This aggregate of streets and parks, this
strange confusion of wealth and squalor, had stood to men and women for
something definitely lovable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>It was not her population
they loved, not the polyglot crowd that swarmed in her streets, but she
herself and all the beauty and intoxication of life she had gathered
into her embrace.</p>
<p>Now she was dead. Whatever fine qualities she had possessed,
whatever vices, had gone from her. She sprawled in all her naked
ugliness, a huge corpse rotting among the hills, awaiting the slow
burial which Nature was tediously preparing.</p>
<p>All those wonderful buildings, the great emporiums in the West End,
the magnificent banks and insurance offices, museums and picture
galleries, regarded as the storehouses of incalculable wealth, vast
hotels, palatial private residences, the thundering railway termini,
Government offices, Houses of Parliament, theatres, churches and
cathedrals, all had become meaningless symbols. All had represented
some activity, some ambition of man, and man had fled to the country
for food, leaving behind the worthless tokens of wealth that had
intrigued him for so many centuries.</p>
<p>Gold and silver grew tarnished in huge safes that none wished to
rifle, banknotes became mildewed, damp and fungus crept into the
museums and picture galleries, and in the whole of Great Britain there
was none to grieve. Every living man and woman was back at the work of
their ancestors, praying once more to Ceres or Demeter, working with
bent back to produce the first essentials of life.</p>
<p>Each individual must produce until such time as there was once more
a superfluity, until barns were filled and wealth re-created, until the
strong had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>seized from the weak and demanded labour in
return for the use of the stolen instrument, until civilization had
sprung anew from the soil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile London was not a city of the dead, but a dead city.

<p class="first">July came in with temperate heat and occasional
showers, ideal weather for the crops; for all the precious growths
which must ripen before the famine could be stayed. The sudden stoppage
of all imports, and the flight of the great urban population into the
country, had demonstrated beyond all question the poverty of
England&rsquo;s resources of food supply, and the demonstration was to
prove of value although there was no economist left to theorize.
England was once again an independent unit, and no longer a member of a
great world-body. Indeed England was being subdivided. The unit of
organization was shrinking with amazing rapidity. The necessity for
concentration grew with every week that passed, the fluidity of the
superfluous labour was being resolved by death from starvation. The
women who wandered from one farm to the next died by the way.</p>
<p>In the Putney house, Mrs Gosling and her daughters were faced by the
failure of their food supply. The older woman had little initiative.
She was a true Londoner. Her training and all the circumstances of her
life had narrowed her imaginative grasp till she was only able to
comprehend one issue. And as yet her daughters, and more particularly
Millie, were so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130"
name="pb130">130</a>]</span>influenced by their mother&rsquo;s thought
that they, also, had shown little evidence of adaptability to the
changed conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall &rsquo;ave to be careful,&rdquo; was Mrs
Gosling&rsquo;s first expression of the necessity for looking to the
future. She had arranged the bulk of her stores neatly in one room on
the second floor, and although a goodly array of tins still faced her
she experienced a miserly shrinking from any diminishment of their
numbers. Moreover, she had long been without such necessities as flour.
Barker and Prince had not dealt in flour.</p>
<p>Returning from her daily inspection one morning in the second week
of July, Mrs Gosling decided that something must be done at once. Fear
of the plague was almost dead, but fear of invasion by starving women
had kept them all close prisoners. That house was a fortress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere, gels,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling when she came
downstairs. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche looked thoughtful. Her own mind had already begun to work on
that great problem of their future. Millie, lazy and indifferent,
shrugged her shoulders and replied: &ldquo;All very well, mother, but
what <i>can</i> we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I been thinking as it&rsquo;s very likely as things
ain&rsquo;t so bad in some places as they are just about
&rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling. &ldquo;We got plenty o&rsquo;
money left, and it seems to me as two of us &rsquo;ad better go out and
&rsquo;ave a look about, London way. One of us could look after the
&rsquo;ouse easy enough, now. We &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t &rsquo;ardly seen
a soul about the past fortnight.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>The suggestion brought a gleam of hope to Blanche. She visualized
the London she had known. It might be that in the heart of the town,
business had begun again, that shops were open and people at work. It
might be that she could find work there. She was longing for the sight
and movement of life, after these two awful months of isolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on,&rdquo; she said briskly. &ldquo;Me and Millie
had better go, mother, we can walk farther. You can lock up after us
and you needn&rsquo;t open the door to anyone. Are you on,
Mill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make ourselves look a bit more decent first,&rdquo;
said Millie, glancing at the mirror over the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; returned Blanche, &ldquo;we brought
one box of clothes with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent some minutes in discussing the resources of their
wardrobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the worst we could fetch some more things from
Wisteria. I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone has touched &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
suggested Blanche.</p>
<p>At the mention of the house in Wisteria Grove, Mrs Gosling sighed
noticeably. She was by no means satisfied with the place at Putney, and
she could not rid herself of the idea that there must be accessible gas
and water in Kilburn, as there had always been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might go up there one day and &rsquo;ave a look at
the place,&rdquo; she put in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite likely
they&rsquo;ve got things goin&rsquo; again up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than an hour Blanche and Millie had made themselves
presentable. Life had begun to stir again in humanity. The atmosphere
of horror which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132"
name="pb132">132</a>]</span>plague had brought was being lifted. It was
as if the dead germs had filled the air with an invisible, impalpable
dust, that had exercised a strange power of depression. The spirit of
death had hung over the whole world and paralyzed all activity. Now the
dust was dispersing. The spirit was withdrawing to the unknown deeps
from which it had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nice to feel decent again,&rdquo; said Blanche. She
lifted her head and threw back her shoulders.</p>
<p>Millie was preening herself before the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure you <i>&rsquo;ave</i> made yourselves
look smart,&rdquo; said their mother with a touch of pride. &ldquo;They
were good girls,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;if there had been more
than a bit of temper shown lately. But, then, who could have helped
themselves? It had been a terrible time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The July sun was shining brilliantly as the two young women,
presentable enough to attend morning service at the Church of St John
the Evangelist, Kilburn, set out to exhibit their charms and to buy
food in the dead city.</p>

<p class="first">They crossed Putney Bridge and made their way towards
Hammersmith.</p>
<p>The air was miraculously clear. The detail of the streets was so
sharp and bright that it was as if they saw with wonderfully renewed
and sensitive eyes. The phenomenon produced a sense of exhilaration.
They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>were conscious of quickened emotion, of a
sensation of physical well-being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it <i>clean</i>?&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Funny!&rdquo; returned Millie. &ldquo;Like those
photographs of foreign places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under their feet was an accumulation of sharp, dry dust, detritus of
stone, asphalt and steel. In corners where the fugitive rubbish had
found refuge from the driving wind, the dust had accumulated in flat
mounds, broken by scraps of paper or the torn flag of some rain-soaked
poster that gave an untidy air of human refuse. Across the open way of
certain roads the dust lay in a waved pattern of nearly parallel lines,
like the ridged sand of the foreshore.</p>
<p>For some time they kept to the pavements from force of habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mill, don&rsquo;t you feel adventurous?&rdquo; asked
Blanche.</p>
<p>Millie looked dissatisfied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so lonely, B.,&rdquo;
was her expression of feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never had London all to myself before,&rdquo; said
Blanche.</p>
<p>Near Hammersmith Broadway they saw a tram standing on the rails. Its
thin tentacle still clung to the overhead wire that had once given it
life, as if it waited there patiently hoping for a renewal of the
exhilarating current.</p>
<p>Almost unconsciously Blanche and Millie quickened their pace.
Perhaps this was the outermost dying ripple of life, the furthest
outpost of the new activity that was springing up in central
London.</p>
<p>But the tram was guarded by something that in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>the
hot, still air seemed to surround it with an almost visible mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eugh!&rdquo; ejaculated Millie and shrank back.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Blanche. It&rsquo;s awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche&rsquo;s hand also had leapt to her face, but she took a few
steps forward and peered into the sunlit case of steel and glass. She
saw a heap of clothes about the framework of a grotesquely jointed
scarecrow, and the gleam of something round, smooth and white.</p>
<p>She screamed faintly, and a filthy dog crept, with a thin yelp, from
under the seat and came to the door of the tram. For a moment it stood
there with an air that was half placatory, wrinkling its nose and
feebly raising a stump of propitiatory tail, then, with another
protesting yelp, it crept back, furtive and ashamed, to its unlawful
meat.</p>
<p>The two girls, handkerchief to nose, hurried by breathless, with
bent heads. A little past Hammersmith Broadway they had their first
sight of human life. Two gaunt faces looked out at them from an upper
window. Blanche waved her hand, but the women in the house,
half-wondering, half-fearful, at the strange sight of these two
fancifully dressed girls, shook their heads and drew back. Doubtless
there was some secret hoard of food in that house and the inmates
feared the demands of charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we aren&rsquo;t quite the last, anyway,&rdquo;
commented Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were they afraid of?&rdquo; asked Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought we wanted to cadge, I expect,&rdquo; suggested
Blanche. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean things,&rdquo; was her sister&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! <i>we</i> weren&rsquo;t so over-anxious to have
visitors,&rdquo; Blanche reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i> didn&rsquo;t want their beastly food,&rdquo;
complained the affronted Millie.</p>
<p>The shops in Hammersmith did not offer much inducement to
exploration. Some were still closely shuttered, others presented goods
that offered no temptation, such as hardware; but the majority had
already been pillaged and devastated. Most of that work had been done
in the early days of the plague when panic had reigned, and many men
were left to lead the raids on the preserves of food.</p>
<p>Only one great line of shuttered fronts induced the two girls to
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to go to Wisteria for clothes,&rdquo; suggested
Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could we get in?&rdquo; asked Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! get in some way easy enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stealing,&rdquo; said Millie, and thought of her
raid on the Kilburn tobacconist&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t steal from dead people,&rdquo; explained
Blanche; &ldquo;besides, who&rsquo;ll have the things if we
don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;d be all right,&rdquo; hesitated Millie,
obviously tempted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; returned Blanche and paused. &ldquo;I
say, Mill,&rdquo; she burst out suddenly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s all the
West-end to choose from. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they walked more quickly.</p>
<p>In Kensington High Street they had an adventure. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>They
saw a woman decked in gorgeous silks, strung and studded with jewels
from head to foot. She walked with a slow and flaunting step,
gesticulating, and talking. Every now and again she would pause and
draw herself up with an affectation of immense dignity, finger the
ropes of jewels at her breast, and make a slow gesture with her
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; whispered Blanche, and the two girls,
terrified and trembling, hastily took refuge in a great square cave
full of litter and refuse that had once been a grocer&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>The woman passed their hiding-place in her stately progress westward
without giving any sign that she was conscious of their presence. When
she was nearly opposite to them she made one of her stately pauses.
&ldquo;Queen of all the Earth,&rdquo; they heard her say, &ldquo;Queen
and Empress. Queen of the Earth.&rdquo; Her hand went up to her head
and touched a strange collection of jewels pinned in her hair, of
tiaras and brooches that flashed brighter than the high lights of the
brilliant sun. One carelessly fastened brooch fell and she pushed it
aside with her foot. &ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; she said in her
high, wavering voice, &ldquo;you understand, Queen and Empress, Queen
of the Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard the refrain of her gratified ambition repeated as she
moved slowly away.</p>
<p>A long submerged memory rose to the threshold of Millie&rsquo;s
mind. &ldquo;Thieving slut,&rdquo; she murmured. <span class=

<p class="first">As they came nearer to representative London the signs
of deserted traffic were more numerous. By the Albert Memorial they saw
an overturned motor-bus which had smashed into the park railings, and a
little further on were two more buses, one standing decently at the
curb, the other sprawling across the middle of the road. The wheels of
both were axle deep in the dust which had blown against them, and out
of the dust a few weak threads of grass were sprouting. There were
other vehicles, too, cabs, lorries and carts: not a great number
altogether, but even the fifty or so which the girls saw between
Kensington and Knightsbridge offered sufficient testimony to the awful
rapidity with which the plague had spread. For it seems probable that
in the majority of cases the drivers of these deserted vehicles must
have been attacked by the first agonizing pains at the base of the
skull while they were actually employed in driving their machines.
There were few skeletons to be seen. The lull which intervened between
the first unmistakable symptoms of the plague and the oncoming of the
paralysis had given men time to obey their instinct to die in
seclusion, the old instinct so little altered by civilization. Those
vestiges of humanity which remained had, for the most part, been
cleansed by the processes of Nature, but twice the girls disturbed a
horrible cloud of blue flies which rose with an angry buzzing so loud
that the girls screamed and ran, leaving the scavengers to swoop
eagerly back upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138"
name="pb138">138</a>]</span>their carrion. Doubtless the thing in the
Hammersmith tram had been the body of a woman, recently-dead from
starvation. Even from the houses there was now little exhalation.</p>
<p>In Knightsbridge, a little past the top of Sloane Street, Blanche
and Millie came to a shop which diverted them from their exploration
for a time. Most of the huge rolling shutters had been pulled down and
secured, but one had stopped half way, and, beyond, the great
plate-glass windows were uncovered. One of ten million tragedies had
descended swiftly to interrupt the closing of that immense place, and
some combination of circumstances had followed to prevent the
completion of the work. The imaginative might stop to speculate on the
mystery of that half-closed shutter; the two Goslings stopped to admire
the wonders behind the glass.</p>
<p>For a time the desolation and silence of London were forgotten. In
imagination Blanche and Millie were once again units in the vast crowd
of antagonists striving valiantly to win some prize in the great
competition between the boast of wealth and the pathetic endeavour of
make-believe.</p>
<p>They stayed to gaze at the &ldquo;creations&rdquo; behind the
windows, at dummies draped in costly fabrics such as they had only
dreamed of wearing. The silks, satins and velvets were whitened now
with the thin snow of dust that had fallen upon them, but to Blanche
and Millie they appeared still as wonders of beauty.</p>
<p>For a minute or two they criticized the models. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>They
spoke at first in low voices, for the deep stillness of London held
them in unconscious awe, but as they became lost in the fascination of
their subject they forgot their fear. And then they looked at one
another a little guiltily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm in seeing if the door&rsquo;s locked, anyway,&rdquo;
said Blanche.</p>
<p>Millie looked over her shoulder and saw no movement in the frozen
streets, save the sweep of one exploring swallow. Even the sparrows had
deserted the streets. She did not reply in words, but signified her
agreement of thought by a movement towards the entrance.</p>
<p>The swing doors were not fastened, and they entered stealthily.</p>
<p>They began with the touch of appraising fingers, wandering from room
to room. But most of the rooms on the ground floor were darkened by the
drawn shutters, and no glow of light came in response to the clicking
of the electric switches that they experimented with with persistent
futility. So they adventured into the clearly lit rooms upstairs and
experienced a fallacious sense of security in the knowledge that they
were on the floor above the street.</p>
<p>Fingering gave place to still closer inspection. They lifted the
models from the stands and shook them out. They held up gorgeous robes
in front of their own suburban dresses and admired each other and
themselves in the numerous cheval glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! bother!&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche at last,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! B.&rdquo; expostulated the more timid Millie.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! why to goodness not?&rdquo; asked her elder sister.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to be any the wiser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems wrong, somehow,&rdquo; replied Millie, unable to shake
off the conventions which had so long served her as conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am,&rdquo; said Blanche, and retired into a little
side room to divest herself of her own dress. She had always shared a
bedroom with her sister, and they observed few modesties before each
other, but Blanche was mentally incapable of changing her dress in the
broad avenues of that extensive show-room. It is true that the tall
casement windows were wide open and the place was completely overlooked
by the massive buildings opposite, but even if the windows had been
screened she would not have changed her skirt in the publicity of that
open place, though every human being in the world were dead.</p>
<p>When she emerged from her dressing-room she was transformed indeed.
She went over to her still hesitating sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do me up, Mill,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Blanche had chosen well; the fine cloth walking dress admirably
fitted her well-developed young figure. When she had discarded her hat
and touched up her hair before the glass, only her boots and her hands
remained to spoil the disguise. Well gloved and well shod, she might
have passed down the Bond Street of the old London, and few women and
no man would have known that she had not sprung from the ruling
classes.</p>
<p>She posed. She stepped back from the mirror and half-unconsciously
fell to imitating the manners of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141"
href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>the revered aristocracy she
had respectfully studied from a distance.</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was joined by Millie, also arrayed in
peacock&rsquo;s feathers and anxious to be &ldquo;fastened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their excitement increased. Walking dresses gave place to evening
gowns. They lost their sense of fear and ran into other departments
searching for long white gloves to hide the disfigurements of household
work. They paraded and bowed to each other. The climax came when they
discovered a Court dress, immensely trained, and embroidered with gold
thread, laid by with evidences of tenderest care in endless wrappings
of tissue paper. Surely the dress of some elegant young duchess!</p>
<p>For a moment they wrangled, but Blanche triumphed. &ldquo;You shall
have it afterwards,&rdquo; she said, as she ran to her
dressing-room.</p>
<p>Millie followed in an elaborate gown of Indian silk; a somewhat
sulky Millie, inclined to resent her duty of lady&rsquo;s maid. She
dragged disrespectfully at the innumerable fastenings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My!&rdquo; ejaculated Blanche when she could indulge herself
in the glory of full examination before a cheval glass in the open
show-room. She struggled with her train and when she had arranged it to
her satisfaction, threw back her shoulders and lifted her chin
haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have some diamonds,&rdquo; she reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It drags round the hips,&rdquo; was Millie&rsquo;s
criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should say &lsquo;Your Majesty,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
corrected Blanche. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! a Queen, are you?&rdquo; asked Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queen of all the Earth,&rdquo; sneered Millie.</p>
<p>Blanche&rsquo;s face suddenly fell. &ldquo;I wonder if she began
like this,&rdquo; she said, and a note of fear had come into her
voice.</p>
<p>Millie&rsquo;s eyes reflected her sister&rsquo;s alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! let&rsquo;s get out of this, B.,&rdquo; she said, and
began to tear at the neck of her Indian silk gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted diamonds, too,&rdquo; persisted Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! B., it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> right,&rdquo; said Millie.
&ldquo;I said it wasn&rsquo;t right and you <i>would</i>
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence descended upon them for a moment, and then both sisters
suddenly screamed and ducked, putting up their hands to their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! What was that?&rdquo; cried Blanche.</p>
<p>A swallow had swept in through the open window, had curved round in
one swift movement, and shot out again into the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a bird of some sort,&rdquo; said Millie, but she was
trembling and on the verge of hysterics. &ldquo;Do let&rsquo;s get out,
B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had put on their own clothes once more they became aware
that they were hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>have</i> wasted a lot of time here,&rdquo; said Blanche
as they made their way out.</p>
<p>She did not pause to wonder how many women had spent the best part
of their lives in a precisely similar manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we ought to have been looking for food,&rdquo; she added.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; replied Millie. &ldquo;That place has given
me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Growing rather tired and footsore they made their way
to Piccadilly Circus, and so on to the Strand. Everywhere they found
the same conditions: a few skeletons, a few deserted vehicles, young
vegetation taking hold wherever a pinch of soil had found an abiding
place, and over all a great silence. But food there was none that they
were able to find, though it is probable that a careful investigation
of cellars and underground places might have furnished some results.
The more salient resources of London had been effectively pillaged so
far as the West-end was concerned. They were too late.</p>
<p>In Trafalgar Square, Millie sat down and cried. Blanche made no
attempt to comfort her, but sat wide eyed and wondering. Her mind was
opening to new ideas. She was beginning to understand that London was
incapable of supporting even the lives of three women; she was
wrestling with the problem of existence. Every one had gone. Many had
died; but many more, surely, must have fled into the country. She began
to understand that she and her family must also fly into the
country.</p>
<p>Millie still sobbed convulsively now and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Chuck it, Mill,&rdquo; said Blanche at last.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be getting home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie dabbed her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving,&rdquo; she
blubbered. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so am I,&rdquo; returned Blanche. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why I said we&rsquo;d better get home. There&rsquo;s nothing to eat
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is every one dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;ve gone off into the country, and that&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;ve got to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger girl sat up, put her hat straight, and blew her nose.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it awful, B.?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Blanche pinched her lips together. &ldquo;What are you putting your
hat straight for?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t make it any worse,&rdquo; retorted
Millie on the verge of a fresh outburst of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! come on!&rdquo; said Blanche, getting to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I <i>can</i> walk home,&rdquo;
complained Millie; &ldquo;my feet ache so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wait a long time if you&rsquo;re going
to find a bus,&rdquo; returned Blanche.</p>
<p>Three empty taxicabs stood in the rank a few feet away from them,
but it never occurred to either of the two young women to attempt any
experiment with these mechanisms. If the thought had crossed their
minds they would have deemed it absurd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down by Victoria,&rdquo; suggested Blanche.
&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Parliament Square they disturbed a flock of rooks, birds which
had partly changed their natural habits during the past few months and,
owing to the superabundance of one kind of food, were preying on
carrion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Crows,&rdquo; commented Blanche. &ldquo;Beastly
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we could get some water to drink,&rdquo; was
Millie&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the river,&rdquo; suggested Blanche, and
they turned up towards Westminster Bridge.</p>
<p>In one of the tall buildings facing the river Blanche&rsquo;s
attention was caught by an open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mill,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve only
been looking for shops. Let&rsquo;s try one of these houses. We might
find something to eat in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of?&rdquo; sneered Blanche. &ldquo;At the worst
it&rsquo;s skeletons, and we can come out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie shuddered. &ldquo;You go,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by myself, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, you see,&rdquo; said Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s different by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate it,&rdquo; returned Millie with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, in a way, only I&rsquo;m fair starving,&rdquo; said
Blanche. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The building was solidly furnished, and the ground floor, although
somewhat disordered, still suggested a complacent luxury. On the floor
lay a copy of the <i>Evening Chronicle</i>, dated May 10; possibly one
of the last issues of a London journal. Two of the pages were quite
blank, and almost the only advertisement was one hastily-set
announcement of a patent medicine guaranteed as a sure protection
against the plague. The remainder of the paper was filled with reports
of the devastation that was being wrought, reports which were
nevertheless marked by a faint spirit of simulated confidence. Between
the lines could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span>be read the story of desperate men clinging
to hope with splendid courage. There were no signs of panic here.
Groves had come out well at the last.</p>
<p>The two girls hovered over this piece of ancient history for a few
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Blanche triumphantly, &ldquo;even then,
more&rsquo;n two months ago, every one was making for the country. We
shall have to go, too. I told you we should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said we shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Millie.
&ldquo;Anyhow there&rsquo;s nothing to eat here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in this room, there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Blanche,
&ldquo;but there might be in the kitchens. Do you know what this place
has been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a man&rsquo;s club,&rdquo; announced Blanche.
&ldquo;First time you&rsquo;ve been in one, old dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s have a look downstairs, then,&rdquo;
returned Millie, careless of her achievement.</p>
<p>In the first kitchen they found havoc: broken china and glass, empty
bottles, empty tins, cooking utensils on the floor, one table upset,
everywhere devastation and the marks of struggle; but in none of the
empty tins was there the least particle of food. Everything had been
completely cleaned out. The rats had been there, and had gone.</p>
<p>Exploring deeper, however, they were at last rewarded. On a table
stood a whole array of unopened tins and in one of them was plunged a
tin-opener, a single stab had been given, and then, possibly, another
of these common tragedies had begun. Had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>he been alone, that
plunderer, or had his companions fled from him in terror?</p>
<p>Here the two girls made a sufficient meal, and discovered, moreover,
a large store of unopened beer-bottles. They shared the contents of one
between them, and then, feeling greatly reinvigorated, they sought for
and found two baskets, which they filled with tinned foods. They only
took away one bottle of beer&mdash;a special treat for their
mother&mdash;on account of the weight. They remembered that they had a
long walk before them; and they were not over-elated by their
discovery; they were sick to death of tinned meats.</p>
<p>In looking for the baskets they came across a single potato that the
rats had left. From it had sprung a long, thin, etiolated shoot which
had crept under the door of the cupboard and was making its way across
the floor to the light of the window. Already that shoot was several
feet in length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny how they grow,&rdquo; commented Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making for the country, I expect,&rdquo; replied Blanche,
&ldquo;same as we shall have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a relief to them to find their way into the sunlight once
more. Those cold, forsaken houses held some suggestion of horror, of
old activities so abruptly ended by tragedy. From these interiors
Nature was still shut off. That ghostly tendril aching towards the
light had no chance for life and reproduction&#8202;&hellip;.

<p class="first">The two Gosling girls had yet one more adventure
before they toiled home with their load.</p>
<p>They were growing bolder, despite the gloom and oppression of those
human habitations, and some freakish spirit prompted Blanche to suggest
that they should visit the Houses of Parliament. After a brief demur,
Millie acceded.</p>
<p>That great stronghold was open to them now. They might walk the
floor of the House, sit in the Speaker&rsquo;s chair, penetrate into
the sacred places of the Upper Chamber.</p>
<p>Gone were all the rules and formulas, the intricacies and precedents
of an unwritten constitution, the whole cumbrous machinery for the
making of new laws. The air was no longer disturbed by the wranglings,
evasions and cunning shifts of those who had found here a stage for
their personal ambitions. The high talk of progress had died into
silence along with the struggle of parties which had played the supreme
game, side against side, for the prize of power. Progress had been
defined in this place, in terms of human activity, human comfort. The
end in sight had been some vague conception of general welfare through
accumulated riches. And from the sky had fallen a pestilence to change
the meaning of human terms. In three months the old conception of
wealth was gone. Money, precious stones, a thousand accepted forms of
value had become suddenly worthless, of no more account than the symbol
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>power which lay coated with dust on the table of
the House of law-makers. Even law itself, that slow growth of the
centuries, had become meaningless. Who cared if some mad woman
plundered every jeweller&rsquo;s shop in the whole City? Who was to
forbid theft or avenge murder? The place of traffic was empty. Only one
law was left and only one value; the law of self-preservation, the
value of food.</p>
<p>The sunlight fell in broad coloured shafts upon two half-educated
girls come on a plundering expedition, and they might sit in the high
places if they would, and make new laws for themselves.</p>
<p>Blanche sat for a few moments in the Speaker&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine big place,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! come on, B., do,&rdquo; replied Millie. &ldquo;I want to
get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they crossed the Square, Millie looked up at Big Ben.
&ldquo;Quarter-past nine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It must have
stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, silly,&rdquo; replied Blanche. &ldquo;All
the clocks have stopped. Who&rsquo;s to wind &rsquo;em?&rdquo;

<p class="first">For some time Mrs Gosling was quite unable to grasp
the significance of her daughters&rsquo; report on the condition of
London. During the past two months she had persuaded herself that the
traffic of the town was being resumed and that only Putney was still
desolate. She had always disapproved of Putney; it was damp and she had
never known anyone who had lived there. It is true that the late
lamented George Gosling had been born in Putney, but that was more than
half a century ago, the place was no doubt quite different then; and he
had left Putney and gone to live in the healthy North before he was
sixteen. Mrs Gosling was half inclined to blame Putney for all their
misfortunes&mdash;it was sure to breed infection, being so near the
river and all&mdash;and she had become hopeful during the past month
that all would be well with them if they could once get back to
Kilburn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say you didn&rsquo;t see no one at
all?&rdquo; she repeated in great perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those three we&rsquo;ve told you about, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, o&rsquo; course, they&rsquo;re all shut up in the
&rsquo;ouses, still; afraid o&rsquo; the plague and &rsquo;anging on to
what provisions they&rsquo;ve got put by, same as us,&rdquo; was the
hopeful explanation Mrs Gosling put forward. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Millie, and Blanche agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but &rsquo;ow d&rsquo;you know?&rdquo; persisted the
mother. &ldquo;Did you go in to the &rsquo;ouses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One or two,&rdquo; returned Blanche evasively, &ldquo;but
there wasn&rsquo;t no need to go in. You could see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure there was no shops open? Not in the
Strand?&rdquo; Mrs Gosling laid emphasis on the last sentence. She
could not doubt the good faith of the Strand. If that failed her, all
was lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! can&rsquo;t you understand, mother,&rdquo; broke out
Blanche petulantly, &ldquo;that the whole of London is absolutely
deserted? There isn&rsquo;t a soul in the streets. There&rsquo;s no
cabs or buses or trams or anything, and grass growing in the middle of
the road. And all the shops have been broken into, all those that had
food in &rsquo;em, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; words failed her.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it, Millie?&rdquo; she concluded lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful,&rdquo; agreed Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling,
not yet fully convinced. She considered earnestly for a few moments and
then asked: &ldquo;Did you go into Charing Cross Post Office?
They&rsquo;d sure to be open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; lied Blanche, &ldquo;and we could have taken all
the money in the place if we&rsquo;d wanted, and no one any the
wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling looked shocked. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ope my gels&rsquo;ll
never come to that,&rdquo; she said. Her girls, with a wonderful
understanding of their mother&rsquo;s opinions, had omitted to mention
their raid on the Knightsbridge emporium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;d ever know,&rdquo; said Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s One who would,&rdquo; replied Mrs Gosling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>gravely, and strangely enough, perhaps, the two
girls looked uneasy, but they were thinking less of the commandments
miraculously given to Moses than of the probable displeasure of the
Vicar of St John the Evangelist&rsquo;s Church in Kilburn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to do something, anyhow,&rdquo; said
Blanche, after a pause. &ldquo;I mean we&rsquo;ll have to get out of
this and go into the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might go to your uncle&rsquo;s in Liverpool,&rdquo;
suggested Mrs Gosling, tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long walk,&rdquo; remarked Blanche.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling did not grasp the meaning of this objection.
&ldquo;Well, I think we could afford third-class,<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2686" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> she said.
&ldquo;Besides, though we &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t corresponded much of late
years, I&rsquo;ve always been under the impression that your uncle is
doin&rsquo; well in Liverpool; and at such a time as this I&rsquo;m
sure &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll do the right thing, though whether it would be
better to let &rsquo;im know we&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; or not I&rsquo;m
not quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! dear!&rdquo; sighed Blanche, &ldquo;I <i>do</i> wish
you&rsquo;d try to understand, mother. There aren&rsquo;t any trains.
There aren&rsquo;t any posts or telegraphs. Wherever we go we&rsquo;ve
just got to walk. Haven&rsquo;t we, Millie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie began to snivel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;orrible,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> understand it,&rdquo; repeated Mrs
Gosling.</p>
<p>By degrees, however, the controversy took a new shape. Granting for
the moment the main contention that London was uninhabitated, Mrs
Gosling urged that it would be a dangerous, even a foolhardy, thing to
venture into the country. If there was no Government there would be no
law and order, was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>substance of her argument;
government in her mind being represented by its concrete presentation
in the form of the utterly reliable policeman. Furthermore, she pointed
out, that they did not know anyone in the country, with the exception
of a too-distant uncle in Liverpool, and that there would be nowhere
for them to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to work,&rdquo; said Blanche, who was surely
inspired by her glimpse of the silent city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got nearly a &rsquo;undred pounds left of
what your poor father drew out o&rsquo; the bank before we shut
ourselves up,&rdquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we <i>could</i> buy things in the country,&rdquo;
speculated Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem set on the country for some reason,&rdquo; said Mrs
Gosling with a touch of temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to get food,&rdquo; returned Blanche,
raising her voice. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t live on air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if food&rsquo;s to be got cheaper in the country than in
London,&rdquo; snapped Mrs Gosling, &ldquo;my experience goes for
nothing, but, of course, you know best, if I <i>am</i> your
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any food in London, cheap or dear, I keep
telling you,&rdquo; said Blanche, and left the room angrily, slamming
the door behind her.</p>
<p>Millie sat moodily biting her nails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blanche lets &rsquo;er temper get the better of
&rsquo;er,&rdquo; remarked Mrs Gosling addressing the spaces of the
kitchen in which they were sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right, worse luck,&rdquo; said Millie. &ldquo;We
shall have to go. I &rsquo;ate it nearly as much as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The argument thus begun was continued with few <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>intermissions for a whole week. A thunderstorm,
followed by two days of overcast weather, came to the support of the
older woman. One thing was certain among all these terrible
perplexities, namely, that you couldn&rsquo;t start off for a trip to
the country on a wet day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile their stores continued to diminish, and one afternoon Mrs
Gosling consented to take a walk with Blanche as far as Hammersmith
Broadway.</p>
<p>The sight of that blank desert impressed her. Blanche pointed out
the house in which she had seen the two women five days before, but no
one was looking out of the window on that afternoon. Perhaps they had
fled to the country, or were occupied elsewhere in the house, or
perhaps they had left London by the easier way which had become so
general in the past few months.</p>
<p>When she returned to the Putney house, Mrs Gosling wept and wished
she, too, was dead, but she consented at last to Blanche&rsquo;s
continually urged proposition, in so far as she expressed herself
willing to make a move of some sort. She thought they might, at least,
go back and have a look at Wisteria Grove. And if Kilburn had, indeed,
fallen as low as Hammersmith, then there was apparently no help for it
and they must try their luck in the waste and desolation of the
country. Perhaps some farmer&rsquo;s wife might take them in for a
time, until they had a chance to look about them. They had nearly a
hundred pounds in gold.</p>
<p>The girls found a builder&rsquo;s trolley in a yard near by, a truck
of sturdy build on two wheels with a long <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>handle. It bore marks
of having held cement, and there were weeds growing in one end of it,
but after it had been brought home and thoroughly scrubbed, it looked
quite a presentable means for the transport of the
&ldquo;necessaries&rdquo; they proposed to take with them.</p>
<p>They made too generous an estimate of essentials at first, piling
their truck too high for safety and overtaxing their strength; but that
problem, like many others, was finally solved for them by the
clear-sighted guidance of necessity.</p>
<p>They started one morning&mdash;a Monday if their calculations were
not at fault&mdash;about two hours after breakfast. Mrs Gosling and
Millie pushed behind, and Blanche, the inspired one, went before,

direction.</p>
<p>It is possible that they were the last women to leave London.</p>
<p>By chance they discovered the Queen of all the Earth on a doorstep
near Addison Road. She was quite dead, but they did not despoil her of
the jewels with which she was still covered.</p>

<p class="first">Mrs Gosling was a source of trouble from the outset.
She had lived her life indoors. In the Wisteria Grove days, she never
spent two hours of the twenty-four out of the house. Some times for a
whole week she had not gone out at all. It was a mark of their rise in
the world that all the tradesmen called for orders. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>She
had found little necessity to buy in shops during recent years. And so,
very surely, she had grown more and more limited in her outlook. Her
attention had become concentrated on the duties of the housewife. She
had not kept any servant, a charwoman who came for a few hours three
times a week had done all that the mistress of the house had not dared,
in face of neighbourly criticism&mdash;in her position she could not be
seen washing down the little tiled path to the gate nor whitening the
steps.</p>
<p>The effect of this cramped existence on Mrs Gosling would not have
been noticeable under the old conditions. She had become a specialized
creature, admirably adapted to her place in the old scheme of
civilization. No demand was ever made upon her resources other than
those familiar demands which she was so perfectly educated to supply.
Even when the plague had come, she had not been compelled to alter her
mode of life. She had made trouble enough about the lack of many things
she had once believed to be necessary&mdash;familiar foods, soap and
the thousand little conveniences that the twentieth century inventor
had patented to assist the domestic economy of the small householder;
but the trouble was not too great to be overcome. The adaptability
required from her was within the scope of her specialized vision. She
could learn to do without flour, butter, lard, milk, sugar and the
other things, but she could not learn to think on unfamiliar lines.</p>
<p>That was the essence of her trouble. She was divorced from a
permanent home. She was asked to walk long miles in the open air. Worst
of all, she was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157"
name="pb157">157</a>]</span>called upon for initiative, ingenuity; she
was required to exercise her imagination in order to solve a problem
with which she was quite unfamiliar. She was expected to develop the
potentialities of the wild thing, and to extort food from Nature. The
whole problem was beyond her comprehension.</p>
<p>The sight of Kilburn was a great blow to her. She had hoped against
hope that here, at least, she would find some semblance of the life she
had known. It had seemed so impossible to her that Aiken, the
butcher&rsquo;s, or Hobb&rsquo;s, the grocer&rsquo;s, would not be open
as usual, and the vision of those two desolated and ransacked
shops&mdash;the latter with but a few murderous spears of plate-glass
left in its once magnificent windows&mdash;depressed her to tears.</p>
<p>So shaken was she by the sight of these horrors that Blanche and
Millie raised no objection to sleeping that night in the house in
Wisteria Grove. Indeed, the two girls were almost tired out, although
it was yet early in the afternoon. The truck had become very heavy in
the course of the last two miles; and they had had considerable
difficulty in negotiating the hill by Westbourne Park Station.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling was still weeping as she let herself in to her old home,
and she wept as she prowled about the familiar rooms and noted the dust
which had fallen like snow on every surface which would support it. And
for the first time the loss of her husband came home to her. She had
been almost glad when he had vanished from the Putney house&mdash;in
that place she had only seen him in his new character of tyrant. Here,
among familiar associations, she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158"
href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>recalled the fact that he had
been a respectable, complacent, hard-working, successful man who had
never given her cause for trouble, a man who did not drink nor run
after other women, who held a position in the Church and was looked up
to by the neighbourhood. According to her definition he had certainly
been an ideal husband. It is true that they had dropped any pretence of
being in love with one another after Blanche was born, but that was
only natural.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling sat on the bed she had shared with him so long and hoped
he was happy. He was; but if she could have seen the nature of his
happiness the sight would have given her no comfort. Vaguely she
pictured him in some strange Paradise, built upon those conceptions of
the medi&aelig;val artists, mainly Italians, which have supplied the
ideals of the orthodox. She saw an imperfectly transfigured and still
fleshly George Gosling, who did unaccustomed things with a harp, was
dressed in exotic garments and was on terms with certain hybrids,
largely woman but partly bird, who were clearly recognizable as the
angelic host. If she had been a Mohammedan, her vision would have
accorded far more nearly with the fact.</p>

<p class="first">The successful animal is that which is adapted to its
circumstances. Herbert Spencer would appear foolish and incapable in
the society of the young wits who frequent the private bar; he might be
described by them as an old Johnny who knew nothing about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>life. Mrs Gosling in her own home had been a
ruler; she had had authority over her daughters, and, despite the usual
evidences of girlish precocity, she had always been mistress of the
situation. In the affairs of household management she was <i lang=
"fr">facile princeps</i>, and she commanded the respect accorded to the
eminent in any form of specialized activity. But even on this second
morning of their emigration it became clear to Blanche that her mother
had ceased to rule, and must become a subordinate. A certain respect
was due to her in her parental relation, but if she could not be coaxed
she must be coerced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be better when we get her right away from
here,&rdquo; was Blanche&rsquo;s diagnosis, and Millie, who had also
achieved some partial realization of the necessities imposed by the new
conditions, nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to stop here altogether, and, of course, we
can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall starve if we do,&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>From that time Mrs Gosling dropped into the humiliating position of
a kind of mental incapable who must be humoured into obedience.</p>
<p>The first, and in many ways the most difficult, task was to persuade
her away from Kilburn. She clung desperately to that stronghold of her
old life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old to change at my age,&rdquo; she protested,
and when the alternative was clearly put before her, she accepted it
with a flaccidity that was as aggravating as it was unfightable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner die &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling,
&ldquo;than go trapesing about the fields lookin&rsquo; for
somethin&rsquo; to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>eat. I simply couldn&rsquo;t do it.
It&rsquo;s different for you two gels, no doubt. You go and leave me
&rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie might have been tempted to take her mother at her word, but
Blanche never for a moment entertained the idea of leaving her mother
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, mother,&rdquo; she said, desperately, &ldquo;if
you won&rsquo;t come we must all stop here and starve, I suppose.
We&rsquo;ve got enough food to last a fortnight or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke she looked out of the window of that little suburban
house, and for the first time in her life a thought came to her of the
strangeness of preferring such an inconvenient little box to the
adventure of the wider spaces of open country. Outside, the sun was
shining brilliantly, but the windows were dim with dust and
cobwebs.</p>
<p>Yet her mother was comparatively happy in this hovel; she would find
delight in cleaning it, although there was no one to appraise the
result of her effort. She was a specialized animal with habits
precisely analogous to the instincts of other animals and insects.
There were insects who could only live in filth and would die miserably
if removed from their natural surroundings. Mrs Gosling was a
suburban-house insect who would perish in the open air. After all, the
chief difference between insects and men is that the insect is born
perfectly adapted to its specialized existence, man finds, or is forced
into, a place in the scheme after he has come to
maturity&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t leave me
behind,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs Gosling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Blanche, still looking
out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wicked of you to make us stop here and
starve,&rdquo; put in Millie. &ldquo;And even you must see that we
<i>shall</i> starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling wept feebly. She had wept much during the past
twenty-four hours. &ldquo;Where can we go?&rdquo; she wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s country on the other side of Harrow,&rdquo;
said Blanche.</p>
<p>The thought of Harrow or Timbuctoo was equally repugnant to Mrs
Gosling.</p>
<p>Then Millie had an idea. &ldquo;Well, we only brought four bottles
of water with us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;where are we going to get any
more in Kilburn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling racked her brain in the effort to remember some
convenient stream in the neighbourhood. &ldquo;It may rain,&rdquo; she
said feebly at last.</p>
<p>Blanche turned from the window and pointed to the blurred prospect
of sunlit street. &ldquo;We might be dead before the rain came,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>They wore her out in the end.</p>

<p class="first">With Harrow as an immediate objective, they toiled up
Willesden Lane with their hand-cart early the next morning. Blanche
took that route because it was familiar to her, and after passing
Willesden Green, she followed the tram lines.</p>
<p>As they got away from London they came upon evidences of the exodus
which had preceded them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>Bodies of women, for the most part
no longer <span class="corr" id="xd26e2847" title=
"Source: maladorous">malodorous</span>, were not infrequent, and pieces
of household furniture, parcels of clothing, boxes, trunks and smaller
impedimenta lay by the roadside, the superfluities of earlier loads
that had been lightened, however reluctantly.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling blenched at the sight of every body&mdash;only a few of
them could be described as skeletons&mdash;and protested that they were
all going to their death, but Blanche kept on resolutely with a white,
set face, and as Millie followed her example, if with rather less show
of temerity, there was no choice but to follow. When the gradients were
favourable the girls helped their mother on to the truck and gave her a
lift. She was a feeble walker.</p>
<p>Not till they reached Sudbury did they see another living being of
their own species, or any sign of human habitation in the long rows of
dirty houses.</p>
<p>The great surge of migration had spread out from the centre and
become absorbed in circles of ever-widening amplitude. The great entity
of London had eaten its way so far outwards in to arable and pasturage
that within a ten-mile radius from Charing Cross not a thousand women
could be found who had been able to obtain any promise of security from
the products of the soil. And although there were great open spaces of
land, such as Wembley Park, which had to be crossed in the journey
outwards, the exiles had been unable to wait until such time as seed
could be transformed into food by the alchemy of Nature. So the
pressure had been continually outwards, forcing the emigrants toward
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>more distant farms where some fraction of them,
at least, might find work and food until the coming of the harvest. In
Kent, vegetables were comparatively plentiful. In Northern Middlesex
and Buckinghamshire the majority had to depend upon animal food. But in
all the Home Counties and in the neighbourhood of every large town,
famine was following hard upon the heels of the plague, and 70 per cent
of the town-dwelling women and children who had escaped the latter
visitation died of starvation and exposure before the middle of
August.</p>
<p>In the first inner ring, still sparsely populated, were to be found
those who had had vegetable gardens and had been vigorous enough to
protect themselves against the flood of migration which had swept up
against them.</p>
<p>It was the first signs of this inner ring that the Goslings
discovered at Sudbury.</p>

<p class="first">They came upon a little row of cottages, standing back
a few yards from the road. All three women had been engaged in pushing
their trolly up an ascent, and with heads down, and all their physical
energies concentrated upon their task, they did not notice the
startling difference between these cottages and other houses they had
passed, until they stopped to take breath at the summit of the
hill.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling had immediately seated herself upon the sloping pole of
the trolly handle. She was breathing heavily and had her hands pressed
to her sides. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>Millie leaned against the side of the trolly,
her eyes still on the ground. But Blanche had thrown back her shoulders
and opened her lungs, and she saw the banner of smoke that flew from
the middle of the three chimney-stacks&mdash;smoke, in this wilderness,
smoke the sign of human life! To Blanche it seemed the fulfilment of a
great hope. She had begun to wonder if all the world were dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked without eagerness, anticipating some familiar
horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&rdquo; echoed Millie, when she, too, had recognized the
harbinger. But Mrs Gosling did not raise her eyes high enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked stupidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one living in that cottage,&rdquo; said
Blanche, and pointed upwards to the soaring pennant.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Well, to be sure,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I wonder if they&rsquo;d let me sit down and rest for
a few minutes? And perhaps they might be willing to sell me a glass of
milk. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d pay a good price for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can see, anyway,&rdquo; replied Millie, and they roused
themselves and pushed on eagerly. The cottage was not more than thirty
yards away.</p>
<p>Before they reached it, a woman came to the doorway, stared at them
for a moment and then came down to the little wooden gate.</p>
<p>She was a thick-set woman of fifty or so, with iron grey hair cut
close to her head. She wore a tweed skirt which did not reach the tops
of her heavily <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>soled, high boots. She looked capable, energetic
and muscular. And in her hand she carried about three feet of stout
broomstick.</p>
<p>She did not speak until the little procession halted before her
gate, and then she pointed meaningly up the road with her broomstick
and said: &ldquo;Go on. You can&rsquo;t stop here.&rdquo; She spoke
with the voice and inflection of an educated woman.</p>
<p>Blanche paused in the act of setting down the trolly handle. Mrs
Gosling and Millie stared in amazement; they had been prepared to weep
on the neck of this human friend, found at last in the awful desert of
Middlesex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only wanted to buy a little milk,&rdquo; stammered
Blanche, no less astonished than her mother and sister.</p>
<p>The big woman looked them over with something of pity and contempt.
&ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re not dangerous,&rdquo; she sneered and
crossed her great bare fore-arms over the top of the gate. &ldquo;Only
three poor feckless idiots going begging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re <i>not</i> begging,&rdquo; retorted Blanche.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got money and we&rsquo;re willing to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; repeated the woman. She looked up at the sky
and nodded her head, as though beseeching pity for these feeble
creatures. &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;what do you
suppose is the good of money in this world? You can&rsquo;t eat money,
nor wear it, nor use it to light a fire. Now, if you&rsquo;d offered me
a box of matches, you should have had all the milk I can
spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never,&rdquo; put in Mrs Gosling, who had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>feebly come to rest again on the handle of the
trolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my good woman, you never did,&rdquo; said the stranger.
&ldquo;You never could and I should say the chances are that you never
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie was intimidated and shrinking, even Blanche looked a little
nervous, but Mrs Gosling was incapable of feeling fear of a
fellow-woman. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean as you won&rsquo;t sell us a
glass of milk?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a box of matches you&rsquo;ll exchange for
it?&rdquo; asked the stranger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a burning glass I
stole in Harrow, but you can&rsquo;t depend on the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad, the last three
weeks,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ve more money
a&rsquo;ready than you know what to do with, I should &rsquo;ave
thought as you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a been willing to spare a glass o&rsquo;
milk for charity&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger regarded her petitioner with a hard smile.
&ldquo;Charity&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you realize
that I&rsquo;ve had to defend this place like a fort against thousands
of your sort? I&rsquo;ve killed three madwomen who fought me for
possession and buried &rsquo;em in the orchard like cats. I held out
through the first rush and I can hold out now easily enough. You three
are the first I&rsquo;ve seen for a month, and before that they&rsquo;d
begun to get weak and poor. These are your daughters, I suppose, and
the three of you had always depended upon some fool of a man to keep
you. Yes? Well, you deserve all you&rsquo;ve got. Now you can start and
do a little healthy, useful work for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>yourselves.
I&rsquo;ve no pity for you. I&rsquo;ve got a damned fool of a sister
and an old fool of a mother to keep in there,&rdquo; she pointed to the
cottage with her broomstick. &ldquo;Parasitic like you, both of
&rsquo;em, and pretty well all the use they are is to keep the fire
alight. No, my good woman, you get no charity from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had finished her speech, which she delivered with a fluency
and point that suggested familiarity with the platform, the stranger
crossed her arms again over the gate and stared Mrs Gosling out of
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, my dears,&rdquo; said that outraged lady, getting
wearily to her feet. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wish your ears soiled by
such language from a woman as &rsquo;as forgotten the manners of a
lady. But, there, poor thing, I&rsquo;ve no doubt &rsquo;er
&rsquo;ead&rsquo;s been turned with all this trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger smiled grimly and made no reply, but as the Goslings
were moving away, she called out to them suddenly: &ldquo;Hi! You!
There&rsquo;s a witless creature along the road who&rsquo;ll probably
help you. The house is up a side road. Bear round to the
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beast,&rdquo; muttered Blanche when they had gone on a
few yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One o&rsquo; them &lsquo;new&rsquo; women, my dear,&rdquo;
panted Mrs Gosling, who remembered the beginning of the movement and
still clung to the old terminology. <span class="corr" id="xd26e2934"
title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>&rsquo;Orrible unsexed creatures! I
remember how your poor father used to &rsquo;ate &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get even with her,&rdquo; said Millie.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>They bore to the right, and so avoided two turnings which led up
repulsive-looking hills, but they missed the side road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we must have passed it,&rdquo; complained Mrs
Gosling at last. Her sighs had been increasing in volume and poignancy
for the past half-mile, and the prospect of uninhabited country which
lay immediately around her she found infinitely dispiriting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t an &rsquo;ouse in sight,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;and I really don&rsquo;t believe I <i>can</i> walk much
farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche stopped and looked over the fields on her right towards
London. In the distance, blurred by an oily wriggle of heat haze, she
could see the last wave of suburban villas which had broken upon this
shore of open country. They had left the town behind them at last, but
they had not found what they sought. This little arm of land which cut
off Harrow and Wealdstone from the mother lake of London had not
offered sufficient temptation to delay their forerunners in the search
for food. Most of them, with a true instinct for what they sought, had
followed the main road into the Chiltern Hills, and those who for some
cause or another had wandered into this side track had pushed on, even
as Blanche and Millie would have done had they not been dragged back by
their mother&rsquo;s complaints. The sun was falling a little towards
the west, and bird and animal life, which had seemed to rest during the
intenser heat of mid-day, was stirring and calling all about them. A
rabbit lolloped into the road, a few yards away, pricked up its ears,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>stared for an instant, and then scuttled to
cover. A blackbird flew out of the hedge and fled chattering up the
ditch. The air was murmurous with the hum of innumerable insects, and
above Mrs Gosling&rsquo;s head hovered a group of flies which ever and
again bobbed down as if following some concerted plan of action, and
tried to settle on the poor woman&rsquo;s heated face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! get away, do!&rdquo; she panted, and flapped a futile
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How quiet it is!&rdquo; said Blanche; and although the air
was full of sound it did indeed appear that a great hush had fallen
over the earth. No motor-horn threateningly bellowed its automatic
demand for right of way; there was no echo of hoofs nor grind of
wheels; no call of children&rsquo;s voices, nor even the bark of a dog.
The wild things had the place to themselves again, and the sound of
their movements called for no response from civilized minds. The ears
of the Goslings heard, but did not note these, to them, useless
evidences of life. They were straining and alert for the voice of
humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve felt the &rsquo;eat so
much,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling suddenly, and Blanche and Millie both
started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Blanche, and held up a warning finger.</p>
<p>In the distance they heard a sound like the closing of a gate, and
then, very clear and small, a feminine voice. &ldquo;<i>Chuck!</i>
chuck! chuck!&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Chuck! chuck!
<i>chuck!!!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you we&rsquo;d passed it,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>triumphantly. They turned the trolly and began
to retrace their footsteps. Their eager eyes tried to peer through the
spinney of trees which shut them off from the south. Once or twice they
stopped to listen. The voice was fainter now, but they could hear the
squawk of greedily competitive fowls. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">The only side road they could find proved to be no
more than a track through the little wood. They almost passed it a
second time, and hesitated at the gate&mdash;a sturdy five-barred gate
bearing &ldquo;Private&rdquo; on a conspicuous label&mdash;debating
whether this &ldquo;could be right.&rdquo; They still suffered a spasm
of fear at the thought of trespass, and to open this gate and march up
an unknown private road pushing a hand-cart seemed to them an act of
terrible aggression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might leave the cart just inside,&rdquo; suggested
Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get our food stole,&rdquo; said Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one about,&rdquo; urged Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that broomstick woman,&rdquo; said Millie.
&ldquo;She may have followed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I dunno if it&rsquo;s safe to go
foragin&rsquo; in among them trees, neither,&rdquo; continued Mrs
Gosling. &ldquo;Are you sure this is right, Blanche?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; replied Blanche,
with a touch of temper.</p>
<p>They peered through the trees and listened, but no sign of a house
was to be seen, and all was now silent save for the long drone of
innumerable bees about their afternoon business. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! come on!&rdquo; said Blanche at last. She was rapidly
learning to solve all their problems by this simple
formula&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>In the wood they found refuge from those attendant flies which had
hung over them so persistently.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling gave a final flick with her handkerchief and declared
her relief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite pleasant in &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;after the &rsquo;eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls also seemed to find new vigour in the shade of the
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>have</i> got a cheek!&rdquo; said Millie, with a
giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! needs must when the devil drives,&rdquo; returned Mrs
Gosling, &ldquo;and our circumstances is quite out of the ordinary.
Besides which, there can&rsquo;t be any &rsquo;arm in offerin&rsquo; to
buy a glass of milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche tugged at the trolley handle with a flicker of impatience.
Why would her mother be so foolish? Surely she must see that everything
was different now? Blanche was beginning to wonder at and admire the
marvel of her own intelligence. How much cleverer she was than the
others! How much more ready to appreciate and adapt herself to change!
They could not understand this new state of things, but she could, and
she prided herself on her powers of discrimination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s different now,&rdquo; she said to herself.
&ldquo;We can go anywhere and do anything, almost. It&rsquo;s like as
if we were all starting off level again, in a way.&rdquo; She felt
uplifted: she took extraordinary pleasure in her own realization of
facts. A strange, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173"
name="pb173">173</a>]</span>new power had come to her, a power to enjoy
life, through mastery. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s different now,&rdquo;
she repeated. She was conscious of a sense of pity for her mother and
sister.</p>

<p class="first">The road through the wood curved sharply round to the
right, and they came suddenly upon a clearing, and saw the house in
front of them. It was a long, low house, smothered in roses and
creepers, and it stood in a wild garden surrounded by a breast-high
wall of red brick. At the edge of the clearing several cows were lying
under the shade of the trees, reflectively chewing the cud with slow,
deliberate enjoyment, while one, solitary, stood with its head over the
garden gate, motionless, save for an occasional petulant whisp of its
ropey tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, what are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Mrs
Gosling.</p>
<p>The procession halted, and the three women regarded the guardian cow
with every sign of dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo; said Millie feebly, flapping her hands; and
Blanche repeated the intimidation with greater force; but the cow
merely acknowledged the salutation by an irritable sweep of its
tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Orrid brute!&rdquo; muttered Mrs Gosling, and flicked
her handkerchief in the direction of the brute&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Blanche, conceiving a subtle strategy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive it away with the cart.&rdquo; She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>turned the trolly round, and the three of them
grasping the pole, they advanced slowly and warily to the charge,
pushing their siege ram before them. They made a slight detour to
achieve a flank attack and allow the enemy a clear way of retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! what <i>are</i> you doing?&rdquo; said a voice
suddenly, and the three startled Goslings nearly dropped the pole in
their alarm&mdash;they had been so utterly absorbed in their
campaign.</p>
<p>A young woman of sixteen or seventeen, very brown, hot and
dishevelled, was regarding them from the other side of the garden wall
with a stare of amazement that even as they turned was flickering into
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that great brute by the gate, my dear,&rdquo; said
Mrs Gosling, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve just&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean Alice?&rdquo; interrupted the young
woman. &ldquo;Oh! you couldn&rsquo;t go charging poor dear Alice with a
great cart like that! Three of you, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is its name Alice?&rdquo; asked Blanche stupidly. She did not
feel equal to this curious occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Its</i> name!&rdquo; replied the young woman, with scorn.
&ldquo;<i>Her</i> name&rsquo;s Alice, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean.&rdquo; She shook back the hair from her eyes and moved down to
the gate. The cow acknowledged her presence by an indolent toss of the
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but my sweet Alice!&rdquo; protested the young woman;
&ldquo;you must move and let these funny people come in. It really
isn&rsquo;t good for you, dear, to stand about in the sun like this,
and you&rsquo;d much better go and lie down in the shade for a
bit!&rdquo; She gently pulled the gate from under the cow&rsquo;s chin,
and then, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>laying her hands flat on its side, made as if to
push it out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; declared Mrs Gosling, regarding the
performance with much the same awe as she might have vouchsafed to a
lion-tamer in a circus. &ldquo;&rsquo;Oo&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave thought
it&rsquo;d &rsquo;a been that tame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cow, after a moment&rsquo;s resistance, moved off with a
leisurely walk in the direction of the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you funny people, what <i>do</i> you want?&rdquo; asked
the young woman.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling began to explain, but Blanche quickly interposed.
&ldquo;Oh! do be quiet, mother; you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she
said, and continued, before her mother could remonstrate,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come from London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; commented the young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Blanche hesitated. She was
surprised to find that in the light of her wonderful discovery it was
not so easy to define precisely what they ought to want. As the
broomstick woman had said, they were &ldquo;beggars.&rdquo; Fairly
confronted with the problem, Blanche saw no alternative but a candid
acknowledgment of the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want feeding, of course,&rdquo; put in the young woman.
&ldquo;They all do. You needn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re the first.
We&rsquo;ve had dozens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A solution presented itself to Blanche. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t really
want food,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of tinned
things left still, only we&rsquo;re ill with eating tinned things. I
thought, perhaps, you might be willing to let us have some milk and
eggs and vegetables in exchange?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sensible enough,&rdquo; commented the young
woman. &ldquo;If you only knew the things we have been offered! Money
chiefly, of course&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs Gosling opened her mouth, but
Blanche frowned and shook her head&mdash;&ldquo;and it does seem as if
money&rsquo;s about as useless as buttons. In fact, I&rsquo;d sooner
have buttons&mdash;you <i>can</i> use them. But the other funny
things&mdash;bits of old furniture, warming-pans, jewellery! You should
have heard Mrs Isaacson! She was a Jewess who came from Hampstead a
couple of months ago, and she had a lot of jewels she kept in a bag
tied round her waist under her skirt; and when Aunt May and I simply
had to tell her to go she tried to bribe us with an old brooch and
rubbish. She was a terror. But, I say&rdquo;&mdash;she looked at the
sun&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got lots of things to do before
sunset.&rdquo; She paused, and looked at the three Goslings.
&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;are you all right? You
seem all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mrs Gosling began to reply, but Blanche was too quick for her.
&ldquo;Tell me what you mean by &lsquo;all right&rsquo;?&rdquo; she
asked, raising her voice to drown her mother&rsquo;s &ldquo;Well, I
never did &rsquo;ear such&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, mother&rsquo;ll give you any mortal thing
you want,&rdquo; replied the young woman at the gate. &ldquo;Dear old
mater! She simply won&rsquo;t think of what we&rsquo;re going to do in
the winter; and I mean, if you come in for to-night, say, and we let
you have a few odd things, you won&rsquo;t go and plant yourselves on
us like that Mrs Isaacson and one or two others, because if you do,
Aunt May and I will have to turn you out, you know.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What we &rsquo;ave we&rsquo;ll pay for,&rdquo; said Mrs
Gosling with dignity.</p>
<p>The young woman smiled. &ldquo;Oh, I dare say!&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;pay us with those pretty little yellow counters that
aren&rsquo;t the least good to anyone. You wait here half a jiff.
I&rsquo;ll find Aunt May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran up the path and entered the house. A moment later they heard
her calling &ldquo;Aunt May! Auntie&mdash;Aun-<i>tee</i>!&rdquo;
somewhere out at the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s &rsquo;ope &rsquo;er Aunt May&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave
more common sense,&rdquo; remarked Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>Blanche turned on her almost fiercely. &ldquo;For goodness sake,
mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do try and get it out of your head, if
you can, that we can buy things with money. Can&rsquo;t you see that
everything&rsquo;s different? Can&rsquo;t you see that money&rsquo;s no
good, that you can&rsquo;t eat it, or wear it, or light a fire with it,
like that other woman said? <i>Can&rsquo;t</i> you understand, or
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling gaped in amazement. It was incredible that the mind of
Blanche should also have been distorted by this terrible heresy. She
turned in sympathy to Millie, who had taken her mother&rsquo;s seat on
the pole of the trolly, but Millie frowned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;B.&rsquo;s right. You can&rsquo;t buy things with money; not
here, anyway. What&rsquo;d they do with money if they got
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling looked at the trees, at the cows lying at the edge of
the wood, at the sunlit fields beyond the house, but she saw nothing
which suggested an immediate use for gold coin. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme sit down, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What with
the &rsquo;eat and all this walkin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;Oh! what
wouldn&rsquo;t I give for a cup o&rsquo; tea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie got up sulkily and leaned against the wall. &ldquo;I suppose
they&rsquo;ll let us stop here to-night, B.?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t make fools of ourselves,&rdquo; replied
Blanche, spitefully.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling drooped. No inspiration had come to her as it had come
to her daughter. The older woman had become too specialized. She swayed
her head, searching&mdash;like some great larva dug up from its refuse
heap&mdash;confused and feeble in this new strange place of light and
air.</p>
<p>And as Blanche had repeated to herself &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s
different,&rdquo; so Mrs Gosling seized a phrase and clung to it as to
some explanation of this horrible perplexity. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
understand it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> understand
it!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Aunt May appeared after a long interval&mdash;a thin,
brown-faced woman of forty or so. She wore a very short skirt, a
man&rsquo;s jacket and an old deerstalker hat, and she carried a
pitchfork. She must have brought the pitchfork as an emblem of
authority, but she did not handle it as the other woman had handled her
broomstick. The murderous pitchfork appeared little more deadly in her
keeping than does the mace in the House of Commons, but as an emblem
the pitchfork was infinitely more effective. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>Aunt May&rsquo;s questions were pertinent and searching, and after a
few brief explanations had been offered to her she drove off the young
woman, her niece, whom she addressed as &ldquo;Allie,&rdquo; to perform
the many duties which were her share of the day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Allie went, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sleep here to-night,&rdquo; announced Aunt May.
&ldquo;We shall have a meal all together soon after sunset. Till then
you can talk to my sister, who&rsquo;s an invalid. She&rsquo;s always
eager for news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took charge of them as if she were the matron of a workhouse
receiving new inmates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better bring your truck into the garden,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;or Alice will be turning everything over. Inquisitive
brute!&rdquo; she added, snapping her fingers at the cow, who had
returned, and stood within a few feet of them, eyeing the Goslings with
a slow, dull wonder&mdash;a mournfully sleepy beast whose furiously
wakeful tail seemed anxious to rouse its owner out of her torpor.</p>
<p>The invalid sister sat by the window of a small room that faced west
and overlooked the luxuriance of what was still recognizably a
flower-garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister, Mrs Pollard,&rdquo; said Aunt May sharply, and
then addressing the woman who sat huddled in shawls by the window, she
added: &ldquo;Three more strays, Fanny&mdash;from London, Allie tells
me.&rdquo; She went out quickly, closing the door with a vigour which
indicated little tolerance for invalid nerves.</p>
<p>Mrs Pollard stretched out a delicate white hand. &ldquo;Please come
and sit near me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and tell <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>me
about London. It is so long since I have had any news from there.
Perhaps you might be able&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off, and
looked at the three strangers with a certain pathetic eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take me bonnet off, ma&rsquo;am, if you&rsquo;ll
excuse me,&rdquo; remarked Mrs Gosling. She felt at home once more
within the delightful shelter of a house, although slightly overawed by
the aspect of the room and its occupant. About both there was an air of
that class dignity to which Mrs Gosling knew she could never attain.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve felt the &rsquo;eat as I
&rsquo;ave to-day,&rdquo; she remarked politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it been hot?&rdquo; asked Mrs Pollard. &ldquo;To me the
days all seem so much alike. I want you to tell me, were there any
young men in London when you left? You haven&rsquo;t seen any young man
who at all resembles this photograph, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling stared at the silver-framed photograph which Mrs Pollard
took from the table at her side, stared and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen a single man of any kind for two
months,&rdquo; said Blanche, &ldquo;not a single one. Have we,
Millie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie, sitting rather stiffly on her chair, shook her head.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
don&rsquo;t know where they can have all gone to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Pollard did not reply for a moment. She looked steadfastly out
of the window, and tears, which she made no attempt to restrain, chased
each other in little jerks down her smooth pale cheeks. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mrs Gosling pinched her mouth into an expression of suffering
sympathy, and shook her head at her daughters to enforce silence. Was
she not, also, a widow?</p>
<p>After a short pause, Mrs Pollard fumbled in her lap and discovered a
black-bordered pocket-handkerchief&mdash;a reminiscence, doubtless, of
some earlier bereavement. Her expression had been in no way distorted
as she wept, and after the tears had been wiped away no trace of them
disfigured her delicate face. Her voice was still calm and sweet as she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very foolish to go on hoping. I loved too much, and this
trial has been sent to teach me that all love but One is vain, that I
must not set my heart upon things of the earth. And yet I go on hoping
that my poor boy was not cut off in Sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; murmured Mrs Gosling. &ldquo;You
musn&rsquo;t take it to &rsquo;eart too much, ma&rsquo;am. Boys will be
a little wild and no doubt our &rsquo;eavenly Father will make
excuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Pollard shook her head. &ldquo;If it had only been a little
wildness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I should have hope. He is, indeed,
just and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness, but my poor
Alfred became tainted with the terrible doctrines of Rome. It has been
the greatest grief of my life, and I have known much
pain&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; And again the tears slowly welled up and
fell silently down that smooth, unchanging face.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling sniffed sympathetically. The two girls glanced at one
another with slightly raised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href=
"#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>eyebrows and Blanche almost
invisibly shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>The warm evening light threw the waxen-faced, white-shawled figure
of the woman in the window into high relief. Her look of ecstatic
resignation was that of some wonderful medi&aelig;val saint returned
from the age of vision and miracle to a recently purified earth in
which the old ideas of saintship had again become possible. Her
influence was upon the room in which she sat. The sounds of the world
outside, the evening chorus of wild life, the familiar noise of the
farm, seemed to blend into a remote music of prayer&mdash;&ldquo;Kyrie
Eleison! Christe Eleison!&rdquo; Within was a great stillness, as of a
thin and bloodless purity; the long continuance of a single thought
found some echo in every material object. While the silence lasted
everything in that room was responsive to this single keynote of
an&aelig;mic virtue.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling tried desperately to weep without noise, and even the
two girls, falling under the spell, ceased to glance covertly at one
another with that hint of criticism, but sat subdued and weakened as if
some element of life had been taken from them.</p>
<p>The lips of the woman in the window moved noiselessly; her hands
were clasped in her lap. She was praying.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Firm and somewhat clumsy steps were heard in the
passage, the door was pushed roughly open, banging back against the
black oak chair which was set <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183"
href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>behind it, and Aunt May
entered carrying a large tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your dinner, Fanny,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done earlier to-night, in spite of
interruptions.<span class="corr" id="xd26e3204" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> She bustled over to the little table in
the window, pushed back the Bible and photograph with the edge of the
tray until she could release one hand, and then, having driven the tray
into a position of safety, moved Bible and photograph to the centre
table.</p>
<p>There was something protestingly vigorous about her movements, as
though she endeavoured to combat by noise and energy the impoverished
vitality of that emasculate room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you three!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You had better
come out into the kitchen and take your things off and wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Goslings rose, Mrs Pollard turned to them and stretched out
to each in turn her delicate white hand. &ldquo;There is only one
Comforter.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Put your trust in Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling gulped, and Blanche and Millie looked as they used to
look when they attended the Bible-classes held by the vicar&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>Blanche gave a shiver of relief as they came out into the passage.
Her mind was suddenly filled by the astounding thought that everything
was not different&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Supper was laid on the kitchen table&mdash;cold chicken, potatoes
and cabbage, stewed plums and cream, and warm, new milk in a jug; no
bread, no salt, and no pepper.</p>
<p>As the three Goslings washed at the scullery sink <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>they
chattered freely. They felt pleasure at release from some cold,
draining influence; they felt as if they had come out of church after
some long, dull service, into the air and sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s a very &rsquo;oly lady,&rdquo; was
Mrs Gosling&rsquo;s final summary.</p>
<p>Blanche shivered again. &ldquo;Oh! freezing!&rdquo; was her
enigmatic reply.</p>
<p>Millie said it gave her &ldquo;the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were a party of seven at supper&mdash;the meal was referred to
as &ldquo;supper,&rdquo; although to Mrs Pollard it had been dignified
by the name of &ldquo;dinner&rdquo;&mdash;including two young women
whom the Goslings had not hitherto seen; strong, brown-faced girls, who
spoke with a country accent. They had something still of the manner of
servants, but they were treated as equals both by Allie and Aunt
May.</p>
<p>There was little conversation during the meal, however, for all of
them were too intent on the business in hand. To the Goslings that meal
was, indeed, a banquet.</p>
<p>When they had all finished, Aunt May rose at once. &ldquo;Thank
Heaven for daylight,&rdquo; she remarked; &ldquo;but we must set our
brains to work to invent some light for the winter. We haven&rsquo;t a
candle or a drop of oil left,&rdquo; she went on, addressing the
Goslings, &ldquo;and for the past five weeks we have had to bustle to
get everything done before sunset, I can tell you. Last night we
couldn&rsquo;t wash up after supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; replied Blanche.</p>
<p>Aunt May nodded. &ldquo;We all know,&rdquo; she said. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>&ldquo;Now, you three girls, get busy!&rdquo;
And Allie and the two brown-faced young women rose a little
wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting an old woman,&rdquo; remarked Aunt May,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m allowed certain privileges, chief of them that I
don&rsquo;t work after supper. She paused and looked keenly at the
three Goslings. &ldquo;Which of you three is in command?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems as if my eldest, Blanche, that is, &rsquo;as
sort o&rsquo; taken the lead the past few days,&rdquo; began Mrs
Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I thought so,&rdquo; said Aunt May. &ldquo;Well, now,
Blanche, you&rsquo;d better come out into the garden and have a talk
with me, and we&rsquo;ll decide what you had better do. If your mother
and sister would like to go to bed, Allie will show them where they can
sleep.<span class="corr" id="xd26e3248" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She moved away in the direction of the garden and Blanche followed
her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sun had set, but as yet the daylight was scarcely
faded. Under the trees the fowls muttered in subdued cluckings, and
occasionally one of them would flutter up into the lower branches with
a squawk of effort and then settle herself with a great fluttering and
swelling of feathers, and all the suggestion of a fussy matron
preparing for the night&mdash;preparing only, for these early roosters
sat open-eyed and watchful, as if they knew that there was no chance of
sleep for them until every member of that careless crowd below had
found its appointed place in the dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We put &rsquo;em inside in the winter,&rdquo; remarked Aunt
May, as she and Blanche paused, &ldquo;but they prefer the trees. We
haven&rsquo;t any foxes here, but I&rsquo;ve noticed that the wild
things seem to be coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche nodded. She was thinking how much there was to learn
concerning those matters which appertained to the production of
food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re rather a poor lot,&rdquo; Aunt May continued,
&ldquo;but they have to forage for themselves, except for the few bits
of vegetable and such things we can spare them. We&rsquo;ve no corn or
flour or meal of any kind for ourselves yet. But a farmer&rsquo;s wife
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>about a mile from here has got a few acres of
wheat and barley coming on, and we shall help her to harvest and take
our share later. We shall be rich then,&rdquo; she added, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m town-bred, you know,&rdquo; said Blanche.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got an awful lot to learn, Millie and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn quickly enough,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; returned Blanche.</p>
<p>At the end of the orchard through which they had been passing they
came to a knoll, crowned by a great elm. Round the trunk of the elm a
rough seat had been fixed, and here Aunt May sat down with a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blessed thing to earn your own bread day by
day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing to live near
the earth and feel physically tired at night. It&rsquo;s delightful to
be primitive and agricultural, and I love it. But I have a civilized
vice, Blanche. I have a store of cigarettes I stole from a shop in
Harrow, and every night when it&rsquo;s fine I come out here after
supper and smoke three; and when it&rsquo;s wet I smoke &rsquo;em in my
own bedroom, and&mdash;I dream. But to-night I&rsquo;m going to talk to
you, because you want help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She produced a cigarette case and matches from a side pocket of her
jacket, lit a cigarette, inhaled the smoke with a long gasp of
intensest enjoyment, and then said: &ldquo;Men weren&rsquo;t fools, my
dear; they had pockets in their coats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Blanche. She felt puzzled and a little
awkward. She knew that this woman was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>friend, but the
girl&rsquo;s town-bred, objective mind was critical and
embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you smoke?&rdquo; asked Aunt May. &ldquo;I can spare you a
cigarette, though I know the time must come when there won&rsquo;t be
any more. Still, it&rsquo;s a long way off yet. Bless the clever man
who invented air-tight tins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t smoke, thanks,&rdquo; replied Blanche,
conventionally; and, try as she would, she could not keep some hint of
stiffness out of her voice. Modern manners take a long time to
influence suburban homes of the Wisteria Grove type.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! well, you miss a lot!&rdquo; said Aunt May; &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;re better without it, especially now, when tobacco
isn&rsquo;t easy to get, and will soon be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think,&rdquo; asked Blanche, drawing her eyebrows
together, &ldquo;that this sort of thing is going on always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say. Don&rsquo;t ask me, my dear; the problem&rsquo;s
beyond me. What we poor women have got to do is to keep ourselves alive
in the meantime. And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve come out here to
talk about. What about your mother and you two girls? Where are you
going? And what are you proposing to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Blanche.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been trying to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; remarked Aunt May. &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ll
do. I&rsquo;m doubtful about your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to work on a farm, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only where?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been trying to worry out,&rdquo;
said Aunt May. &ldquo;We do get news here, of a sort. Our girls work in
Mrs Jordan&rsquo;s fields, and meet girls and women who come from
Pinner, and the Pinner people hear news from Northwood, and the
Northwood people from somewhere else; and so we get into touch with
half a county. But, coming to your affairs; you see, we here are just
the innermost circle. Most of the women who came from London missed
this place and passed us by, thanks be!&hellip; Now, that poor
unfortunate Miss Grant, down the road, had to defend herself with
weapons. Fortunately she&rsquo;s strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Grant the awful woman with the broomstick?&rdquo;
asked Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not really awful, my dear,&rdquo; said Aunt May,
smiling; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a very good sort. A little rough in her
manners, perhaps, and quite mad about the uselessness of the creatures
we used to know as men, but a fine, generous, unselfish woman, if she
does boast of her three murders. Did she tell you that, by the
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would, of course; and I believe it&rsquo;s true; but her
theory was to defend her own people. She said they&rsquo;d <i>all</i>
have died if she hadn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not sure about the ethic, but
I know dear old Sally Grant meant well. However, I&rsquo;m
wandering&mdash;I often do when I talk like this. The point was that
just this little circle here, close to London, is very thickly
populated, and there&rsquo;s precious little food ready to be got any
way; but you&rsquo;ll have to pass through the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>country beyond Pinner before you&rsquo;ll find a
place where they&rsquo;ll give you work and keep you. There&rsquo;s a
surplus in the next ring, I gather, too much labour and too little to
grow. You&rsquo;ll have to push out into the Chilterns, out to Amersham
at the nearest. It&rsquo;s all on the main road, of course, which is
bad in a general way, because that&rsquo;s the road they all took. But
I think if you&rsquo;ll cut across towards Wycombe you might, perhaps,
find a place of some sort, though whether they&rsquo;ll feed your
mother free gratis I can&rsquo;t say. Women are of all sorts, but this
plague hasn&rsquo;t made &rsquo;em more friendly to one another, or
perhaps it is we notice it more, and the worst of the lot are the
farmers&rsquo; wives and daughters who&rsquo;ve got the land. They get
turned out, though, sometimes. We hear about it. The London women have
made raids; only, you see, the poor dears don&rsquo;t know what to do
with the land when they get it, so they have to keep the few who do
know to teach &rsquo;em&mdash;when they&rsquo;re sensible
enough&mdash;the raiders, I mean. They aren&rsquo;t always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be an adventure,&rdquo; remarked Blanche.</p>
<p>Aunt May threw away the very short end of her second cigarette and
lighted her third. &ldquo;Adventure will do you good,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark under the elm. The things of the night were
coming out. Occasionally a cockchafer would go humming past them, the
bats were flitting swiftly and silently about the orchard, and
presently an owl swept by in one great stride of soundless flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How they are all coming back!&rdquo; murmured <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>Aunt
May. &ldquo;All the wild things. I never saw an owl here before this
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be frightened if you weren&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; said
Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to be frightened of, yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few years&rsquo; time, perhaps. I don&rsquo;t know. We
killed a wild cat who came after the chickens a few days ago. The cats
have gone back already, and the dogs aren&rsquo;t so respectful as they
used to be. The dogs&rsquo;ll interbreed, I suppose, and evolve a
common form&mdash;strike some kind of average in a beast which will be
somewhere near the ancestral type, smaller, probably, I don&rsquo;t
know. It&rsquo;s a wonderful world, and very interesting. I could
almost wish man wouldn&rsquo;t return for twenty years or so&mdash;just
to see how much of his handiwork Nature could undo in the interval. I
often think about it out here in the evenings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew more about it,&rdquo; said Blanche timidly.
&ldquo;Are there any books, do you know, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t want books, my dear. Keep your eyes open and
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lapsed into silence again. The third cigarette was finished,
but Aunt May gave no indication of a desire to get back to the house,
and Blanche&rsquo;s mind was so excited with all the new ideas which
were pouring in upon her that she had forgotten her tiredness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully interesting,&rdquo; she said at last.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so different. Mother and Millie hate it, and
they&rsquo;d <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>like all the old things back; but I don&rsquo;t
think I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right. You&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; replied her
companion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of the new sort, though you might
never have found it out if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the plague. Now,
your sister will do one of two things, in my opinion; either
she&rsquo;ll stop in some place where there&rsquo;s a
man&mdash;there&rsquo;s one at Wycombe, by the way&mdash;and have
children, or she&rsquo;ll turn religious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche was about to ask a question, but Aunt May stopped her.
&ldquo;Never mind about the man, my dear,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn quickly enough. It&rsquo;s like Heaven now,
you see&mdash;no marrying or giving in marriage. With one man to every
thousand women or so, what can you expect? It&rsquo;s no good kicking
against it. It&rsquo;s got to be. That&rsquo;s where
Fanny&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off suddenly, with a little snort
of impatience. &ldquo;I think to-night&rsquo;s an exception,&rdquo; she
went on. &ldquo;I like talking to you, and one simply can&rsquo;t talk
to Allie yet, so just to-night I&rsquo;ll have one more.&rdquo; She
took out her cigarette case with a touch of impatience.</p>
<p>It was dark under the elm now, and she had to hold up her cigarette
case close to her face in order to see the contents. &ldquo;Two
more,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a festival, and for once
I can speak my mind to some one. An imprudence, perhaps, like this
habit of smoking, but I shall probably never see you again, and
I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; interposed Blanche eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not tired? You don&rsquo;t want to go to
bed?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. I love being out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you, but I know you&rsquo;re speaking the
truth,&rdquo; said Aunt May, after a pause. &ldquo;In the darkness and
silence of the night I will make a confession. I look weather-worn and
fifty, I know, but I feel absurdly romantic, only there&rsquo;s no man
in this case. I used to write novels, my dear&mdash;an absurd thing for
any spinster to do, but they paid, and I&rsquo;ve got the itch for
self-expression. That&rsquo;s the one outlet I miss in this new world
of ours. Sally Grant and I can&rsquo;t agree, and, in any case, she
wants to do all the talking. And sometimes I&rsquo;m idiot enough to go
on writing little bits even now when I have become a capable, practical
woman with at least four lives dependent upon me. Well, it shows,
anyhow, that we writing women weren&rsquo;t all
fools&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; She hung on that for a moment or two, and
then continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you religious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I suppose so. We always went to
Church at home,&rdquo; said Blanche. &ldquo;I thought every one was,
almost. Not quite like Mrs Pollard, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said Aunt May. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm
and a lot of good in being religious, if you go about it in the right
way. I don&rsquo;t want to change your opinions, my dear. It&rsquo;s
just a question to me of the right way. And I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> see
that Fanny&rsquo;s way is right. Here we are, and we&rsquo;ve got to
make the best of it; and to my mind that means facing life, and not
shutting yourself into one room with a Bible and spending half your
time on your knees. Fanny never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194"
href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>was good for much. She
brought up Alfred&mdash;my nephew, you know&mdash;with only one idea,
and she stuffed him so full of holiness that the English Church
couldn&rsquo;t hold him, and he had to work some of it off by going
over to Rome. He thought he&rsquo;d have better chances of saintship
there. He was a poor, pale thing, anyway. Of course, that was anathema
to Fanny. She might have forgiven him for committing a murder, but to
become a Roman Catholic&mdash;&mdash;! Oh, Lord! She&rsquo;s been
praying for him ever since. And, my dear, what difference can it make?
Alfred&rsquo;s apostasy, I mean. Do you think it matters what
particular form of worship or pettifogging details of belief you adopt?
Why can&rsquo;t the Churches take each other for granted, and be
generous enough to suppose that all roads lead to Heaven, which is,
according to all accounts, a much better place than Rome? But, oh!
above all, if you have a religion, do be practical! Come out and do
your work, instead of sighing and psalm-singing, and wearying dumb
Heaven with fulsome praise and lamentations of your unworthiness, as if
you were trying to propitiate a rich customer!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my dear, I won&rsquo;t say any more. My last
cigarette&rsquo;s done, and wasted, because I was too excited to enjoy
it. I know I&rsquo;ve been disloyal; but it&rsquo;s my temperament. I
could slap Fanny sometimes. And she shan&rsquo;t have
Allie&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s the night that has affected me.
To-morrow I shall be just as practical as ever, and you&rsquo;ll forget
that you&rsquo;ve seen this side of me. Come along. We must go to
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the greatest night of my life,&rdquo; thought
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>Blanche as they walked back in silence to the
house.</p>
<p>Even when she was in bed, she did not go to sleep at once. She lay
and listened to the heavy breathing of her mother and Millie, and she
wondered. Everything, indeed, was different, but everybody was just the
same, only, in some curious way, individualities seemed more
pronounced.</p>
<p>Could it be that everybody was more natural, that there was less
restraint?</p>
<p>Blanche was not introspective. She did not test the theory on
herself. She thought of the women she had met that day, and of her
mother and Millie.</p>
<p>She fell asleep, determined to be more like Aunt May. <span class=

<p class="first">Allie knocked on the Goslings&rsquo; door at sunrise
the next morning, and Blanche, who had come to bed two hours after her
mother and sister, was the only one to respond. She woke with the
feeling that she had something important to do, and that the affair was
in some way pleasant and inspiring.</p>
<p>Millie was not easily roused. She had slept heavily, and did not
approve the suggestion that she should get up and dress herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, B., all right!&rdquo; she mumbled, and cuddled
down under the bedclothes like a dormouse into its straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! do get up!&rdquo; urged Blanche, impatiently, and at last
resorted to physical force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo; snapped Millie, struggling
to maintain her hold of the blankets. &ldquo;Why <i>can&rsquo;t</i> you
leave me alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s time to get up, lazy!&rdquo; said Blanche,
continuing the struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I said I&rsquo;d get up in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get up then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; said Millie.</p>
<p>Blanche succeeded at last in obtaining possession of the blankets.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wake mother!&rdquo; was Millie&rsquo;s last,
desperate shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try,&rdquo; replied Blanche.</p>
<p>Millie sat up in the bed and wondered vaguely where she was. These
scenes had often been enacted at Wisteria Grove, and her mind had gone
back to those delightful days of peace and security. When full
consciousness returned to her, she was half inclined to cry, and more
than half inclined to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling was quite as difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the time?&rdquo; was her first question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not seven,&rdquo; murmured Mrs
Gosling.</p>
<p>Millie, still sitting on the bed, wondered whether Blanche would let
her get to the blankets which were tumbled on the floor a few feet
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche, anticipating
the attempt.</p>
<p>Finally she lost her temper and shook her mother vigorously.</p>
<p>At that, Mrs Gosling sat up suddenly and stared at her. &ldquo;What
in &rsquo;eaven&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s wrong, gel?&rdquo; she asked. Her
instinct told her with absolute certainty that it was still the middle
of the night by Wisteria Grove standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my goodness! I&rsquo;m going to have my hands full with
you two!&rdquo; broke out Blanche impatiently. Her imagination pictured
for her in that instant how great the trouble would be. She would never
be able to wake them up&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>They took the road before eight o&rsquo;clock. Aunt May was generous
in the matter of eggs and fruit, and she left her many urgent duties to
point the way for the inexperienced explorers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get right out as far as you can,&rdquo; was her parting word
of advice.</p>
<p>They did not see Mrs Pollard again. She was still in bed when they
set out.</p>
</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Despite the promise of another cloudless day, none of
the three travellers set out in high spirits. To all of them, even to
Blanche, it seemed a return to weariness and pain to start out once
more pushing that abominable truck. That truck represented all their
troubles. It had become associated with all the discomforts they had
endured since they left the Putney house. It indicated the paucity of
their possessions, and yet it was intolerably heavy to push. After
their brief return to the comfort and stability of a home and natural
food, this adventuring out into the inhospitable country appeared more
hopeless than ever. If they could have gone without the truck, they
might, at least, have avoided that feeling of horrible certainty. They
might have cheated themselves into the belief that they would return.
The truck was the brand of their vagabondage.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling did not spare her lamentations concerning the
hopelessness of their endeavour, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>gave it as her
opinion that they had been most heartlessly treated by Aunt May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turning out a woman of my age into the roads,&rdquo; she
grumbled. &ldquo;She might &rsquo;ave kept us a day or two, I should
&rsquo;ave thought. It ain&rsquo;t as if we were beggars. We could
&rsquo;ave paid for what we &rsquo;ad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had, indeed, made the suggestion and been repulsed. Aunt May had
firmly put the offer on one side without explanation. She understood
that explanations would be wasted on Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>Millie was inclined to agree with her mother.</p>
<p>Blanche, at the handle, did not interrupt the statement of their
grievances. She was occupied with the problem of the future, trying to
think out some plan in her own confused inconsecutive way.</p>
<p>Their progress was tediously slow. Against the combined brake of the
truck and Mrs Gosling, they did not average two miles an hour; and even
before they came to Pinner it was becoming obvious to the two girls
that they might as well let their mother ride on the trolly as allow
her to lean her weight upon it as she walked.</p>
<p>They took the road through Wealdstone to avoid the hill and found
that they were still in the track of one wing of the foraging army
which had preceded them. That first rush of emigrants had ravaged the
stores and houses as locusts will ravage a stretch of country. The
suburb of regular villas and prim shops had been completely looted.
Doors stood open and windows were smashed; the spread of ugly houses
lay among the fields like an unwholesome eruption, awaiting the healing
process of Nature. Wealdstone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200"
href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>also was deserted by
humanity. The flood had swept on towards the open country.</p>
<p>But as they approached Pinner the signs of devastation and desertion
began to give way. Here and there women could be seen working in the
fields; one or two children scuttled away before the approach of the
Goslings and hid in the hedges, children who had evidently grown
furtive and suspicious, intimidated by the experiences of the past two
months; and when the outlying houses were reached&mdash;detached
suburban villas, once occupied by relatively wealthy middle-class
employers&mdash;it was evident that efforts were being made to restore
the wreckage of kitchen gardens.</p>
<p>The Goslings had reached the point at which the wave had broken
after its great initial energy was spent. Somewhere about this
fifteen-mile limit, varying somewhat according to local conditions, the
real disintegration of the crowd had begun. As the numerous tokens of
the road had shown, a great number of women and children&mdash;possibly
one-fifth of the whole crowd&mdash;had died of starvation and disease
before any harbour was reached. From this fifteen-mile circle outwards,
an increasing number had been stayed in their flight by the
opportunities of obtaining food. Work was urgently demanded for the
future, but the determining factor was the present supply of food, and
the constriction of immediate supply had decided the question of how
great a proportion of the women and children should remain. Here, about
Pinner, was more land than the limited number of workers could till,
but little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>of it was arable, and this year there would be
almost no harvest of grain.</p>
<p>Vaguely, Blanche realized this. She remembered Aunt May&rsquo;s
advice to keep her eyes open, and looking about her as she walked she
found little promise of security in the grass fields and the rare signs
of human activity.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling, eager to find some home at any price, expressed her
usual optimistic opinion with regard to the value of money. She saw
signs of life again, at last, conditions familiar to her. She thought
that they were returning once more to some kind of recognizable
civilization, and began, with some renewal of her old vigour, to advise
that they should find an hotel or inn and take &ldquo;a good look
round&rdquo; before going any further.</p>
<p>Millie, heartened by her mother&rsquo;s belief, was of much the same
opinion, and Blanche was summoned from the pole to listen to the
proposition.</p>
<p>She shook her head stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to argue it out all over again,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;You can just look round and see for yourselves that
there&rsquo;s no food to be got here. We must get further
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling refused to be convinced, and advanced her superior
knowledge of the world to support her judgment of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; said Blanche, at last. &ldquo;Come on
to the inn and see for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inn, however, was deserted. All its available supply of food,
solid and liquid, had long been exhausted, and the gardenless house had
offered no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>particular attractions as a residence. Houses
were cheap in that place, the whole population of Pinner, including
children, did not exceed three hundred persons.</p>
<p>They found a woman working in a garden near by, and she, with
perhaps unnecessary harshness, warned them that they could not stay in
the village. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not enough food for us as it
is,&rdquo; she said, and made some reference to &ldquo;silly
Londoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was an expression with which the Goslings were to become very
familiar in the near future.</p>
<p>The appeal for pity fell on deaf ears. Mrs Gosling learned that she
was only one of many thousands who had made the same appeal.</p>
<p>The sun was high in the sky as they trudged out of Pinner on the
road towards Northwood. It was then Blanche suggested that her mother
should always ride on the trolly, except when they were facing a hill;
and after a few weak protestations the suggestion was accepted. The
trolly was lightened of various useless articles of furniture&mdash;a
grudging sacrifice on the part of Mrs Gosling&mdash;and the party
pushed on at a slightly improved pace.</p>
<p>After her disappointment in Pinner, Mrs Gosling&rsquo;s interest in
life began rapidly to decline. Seated in her truck, she fell into long
fits of brooding on the past. She was too old and too stereotyped to
change, the future held no hope for her, and as the meaning and purpose
of her existence faded, the life forces within her surely and ever more
rapidly ebbed. Reality to her became the discomfort of the sun&rsquo;s
heat, the dust of the road, the creak and scream <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>of
the trolly wheels. She was incapable of relating herself to the great
scheme of life, her consciousness was limited, as it had always been
limited, to her immediate surroundings. She saw herself as a woman
outrageously used by fate, but to fate she gave no name; the very idea,
indeed, was too abstract to be appreciated by her. Blanche, Millie and
that horrible truck were all that was left of her world, and in spirit
she still moved in the beloved, familiar places of her suburban
home.</p>

<p class="first">As the Goslings trudged out into the Chilterns they
came into new conditions. Soon they found over-crowding in place of
desolation. The harvest was ripening and in a month&rsquo;s time the
demand for labour would almost equal the supply, for the labour offered
was quite absurdly unskilled and ten women would be required to perform
the work of one man equipped with machines. But at the end of July the
surplus of women, almost exclusively Londoners, had no employment and
little food, and many were living on grass, nettles, leaves, any green
stuff they could boil and eat, together with such scraps of meat and
vegetables as they could steal or beg. Their experiments with wild
green stuffs often resulted in some form of poisoning, and dysentery
and starvation were rapidly increasing the mortality among them.
Nevertheless, in Rickmansworth houses were still at a premium, and many
of those who camped perforce in fields or by the roadside <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>were
too enfeebled by town-life to stand the exposure of the occasional
cold, wet nights. The majority of the women in this ring were those who
had been too weak to struggle on. They represented the class least
fitted to adapt themselves to the new conditions. The stronger and more
capable had persisted, and left these congested areas behind them; and
it was evident that in a very few months a balance between labour and
supply would be struck by the relentless extermination of the weakest
by starvation and disease.</p>
<p>Blanche, if she was unable to grasp the problem which was being so
inevitably solved by the forces of natural law, was at least able to
recognize clearly enough that she and her two dependents must not
linger in the district to which they had now come. Aunt May had warned
her that she must push out as far as Amersham at the nearest, but
Millie was too tired and footsore to go much further than Rickmansworth
that night, and after a fruitless search for shelter they camped out
half a mile from the town in the direction of Chorley Wood.</p>
<p>They made some kind of a shield from the weather by emptying and
tilting the trolly, and they hid their supply of food behind them at
the lowest point of this species of lean-to roof. The two girls had
realized that that supply would soon be raided if the fact of its
existence were to become known. They had been the object of much
scrutiny as they passed, and their appearance of well-being had
prompted endless demands for food, from that pitiful crowd of emaciated
women and children. It had been a demand <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>quickly put on one
side by lying. Their applicants found it only too easy to believe that
the Goslings had no food hidden in the truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hated to refuse some of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Blanche said as
they carefully hid what food was left to them, before turning in for
the night, &ldquo;but what good would our little bit have done among
all that lot? It would have been gone in half a jiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; agreed Millie.</p>
<p>Mrs Gosling had taken little notice of the starving crowd.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got nothin&rsquo; to give you,&rdquo; was her one
form of reply. She might have been dealing with hawkers in Wisteria
Grove.</p>
<p>She was curiously apathetic all that afternoon and evening, and
raised only the feeblest protestation against the necessity for
sleeping in the open air. But she was very restless during the night,
her limbs twitched and she moved continually, muttering and sometimes
crying out. And as the three women were all huddled together, partly to
make the most of their somewhat insufficient lean-to, and partly
because they were afraid of the terrors of the open air, both Blanche
and Millie were constantly aroused by their mother&rsquo;s movements.
Once they heard her calling urgently for &ldquo;George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s odd, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; whispered Blanche
after one such disturbance. &ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s going to be
ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; muttered Millie. &ldquo;Who
wouldn&rsquo;t be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Blanche was very careful with their food. For
breakfast they ate only part of a tin of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>condensed beef
between them&mdash;Mrs Gosling indeed ate hardly anything. The eggs
which they had brought from Sudbury they reserved, chiefly because they
had neither water nor fire.</p>
<p>They drank from a stream, later, and at midday Blanche and Millie
each ate one of the eggs raw. Mrs Gosling refused all food on this
occasion. She had been very quiet all the morning, and had made little
complaint when she had been forced to walk the many hills which they
were now encountering.</p>
<p>Blanche was uneasy and tried to induce her mother to talk. &ldquo;Do
you feel bad, mother?&rdquo; she asked continually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could get &rsquo;ome,&rdquo; was all the reply she
received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be all right when we can get settled
somewhere,&rdquo; grumbled Millie. &ldquo;If such a time ever
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">They came to Amersham in the afternoon. The signs of
misery and starvation were here less marked. They were approaching the
outer edge of this ring of compression, having passed through the node
at Rickmansworth. The faint relief of pressure was evidenced to some
extent in the attitude of the people they addressed. It is true that no
immediate hope of food and employment were held out to them, but on the
one hand Blanche&rsquo;s inquiries were answered with less acerbity and
on the other they were less besieged by importunate demands for
charity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>Blanche gave an egg to one precocious girl of
thirteen or so, who insisted on helping them to push the truck uphill,
and she and Millie watched the deft way in which the child broke the
shell at one end and sucked out the contents. Their own methods had
been both unclean and wasteful.</p>
<p>They turned off the Aylesbury Road, towards High Wycombe late in the
afternoon and about a mile from Amersham came to a farm where they made
their last inquiry that day.</p>
<p>Blanche saw signs of life in the outbuildings and went to
investigate, leaving Millie and her mother to guard the truck. She
found three women and a girl of fourteen or so milking. For some
minutes she stood watching them, the women, after one glance at her,
proceeding with their work without paying her any further attention.
But, at last, the eldest of the three rose from her stool with a sigh
of relief, picked up her wooden bucket of milk, gave the cow a
resounding slap on the side, and then, turning to Blanche, said,
&ldquo;Well, my gal, what&rsquo;s for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you change two pints of milk for a small tin of
tongue?&rdquo; asked Blanche. It was the first time she had offered any
of their precious tinned meats in exchange for other food, but she
wanted milk for her mother, who had hardly eaten anything that day.</p>
<p>The two other women and the girl looked round and regarded Blanche
with the first signs of interest they had shown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tongue, eh?&rdquo; said the older woman. &ldquo;Where from
did you get tongue, my gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;London,&rdquo; replied Blanche tersely. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you leave there?&rdquo; asked the woman, and then
Blanche was engaged in a series of searching questions respecting the
country she had passed through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have the milk if you&rsquo;ve anything to put it
in,&rdquo; said the woman at last, and Blanche went to fetch the tongue
and the two bottles that they had had from Aunt May.</p>
<p>The bottles had to be scalded, a precaution that had not occurred to
Blanche, and one of the other women was sent to carry out the
operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your tale don&rsquo;t tell us much,&rdquo; said the
woman of the farm, &ldquo;but we always pass the news here, now. Where
are you going to sleep to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sleep here in the outhouses, if you&rsquo;ve a mind
to,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;but I warn you we get a crowd. Silly
Londoners like yourself for the most part, but we find a use for
&rsquo;em somehow, though I&rsquo;d give the lot for three
labourers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and twisted her mouth on one side reflectively.
&ldquo;Ah! well,&rdquo; she went on with a sigh, &ldquo;no use grieving
over them that&rsquo;s gone; all I was goin&rsquo; to say was, if you
sleep here you&rsquo;d better keep an eye on what food you&rsquo;ve got
with you. My lot&rsquo;ll have it before you can say knife, if they get
half a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t us girls, me and my sister,&rdquo; explained
Blanche. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my mother. She&rsquo;s bad, I&rsquo;m
afraid. If she could sleep in your kitchen&#8202;&hellip;? <i>She</i>
wouldn&rsquo;t steal anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short hesitation the woman consented. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>Yet neither the glory of being once more within the four walls of a
house, nor the refreshment of the milk which she drank readily enough,
seemed appreciably to rouse Mrs Gosling&rsquo;s spirits.</p>
<p>The woman of the farm, a kindly enough creature, plied the old lady
with questions, but received few and confused answers in reply. Mrs
Gosling seemed dazed and stupid. &ldquo;A touch of the sun,&rdquo; the
farmer&rsquo;s widow thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s been cruel strong the past week,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;ll be all right in a day or two, get her to
shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>That night the farmer&rsquo;s widow said no more on that subject.
She allowed the three Goslings to sleep in an upstair room, in which
there was one small bed for the mother, and the two girls slept on the
floor. Exchanging confidence for confidence, they brought their truck
into the kitchen; and then the farmer&rsquo;s widow proceeded to lock
up for the night, an elaborate business, which included the fastening
of all ground-floor windows and shutters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thievin&rsquo; crowd we&rsquo;ve got about
here,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t blame them or
anyone when there ain&rsquo;t enough food to go round. But we have to
be careful for &rsquo;em. Let &rsquo;em go their own way and
they&rsquo;d eat up everything in a week and then starve. It looks like
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3624" title=
"Source: your">you&rsquo;re</span> being hard on &rsquo;em, but
it&rsquo;s for their own good. There&rsquo;s some, of course,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;as you have got to get shut of. Only yesterday I
had to send one of &rsquo;em packing. A Jew <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>woman she was, called &rsquo;erself Mrs Isaacson
or something. She was a caution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche wondered idly if this were the same Mrs Isaacson who had
stayed too long with Aunt May.</p>
<p>The woman of the farm roused the Goslings at sunrise, and she, like
Aunt May, had a brisk, practical, morning manner.</p>
<p>She gave the travellers no more food, but when they were nearly
ready to take the road again she gave them one valuable piece of
information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d make through
Wycombe straight along the road here, and go up over the hill to
Marlow. Mind you, they won&rsquo;t let every one stop there. But you
look two healthy gals enough and it&rsquo;s getting on towards harvest
when there&rsquo;ll be work as you <i>can</i> do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marlow?&rdquo; repeated Blanche, fixing the name in her
memory.</p>
<p>The farmer&rsquo;s widow nodded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man
there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A queer sort, by all accounts. Not like
Sam Evans, the butcher at Wycombe, he ain&rsquo;t. Seems as this Marlow
chap don&rsquo;t have no truck with gals, except setting &rsquo;em to
work. However, time&rsquo;ll show. He may change his mind
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had some difficulty with Mrs Gosling. She refused feebly to
leave the house. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t fit to go out,&rdquo; she
complained, and when they insisted she asked if they were going
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; whispered the woman
of the farm. &ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s got to her head a bit. She&rsquo;ll
be all right when you get her to Marlow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche accepted the suggestion, and by this subterfuge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>Mrs
Gosling was persuaded into the truck. The girl found the ruins of an
umbrella, which they rigged up to protect her from the sun.</p>
<p>Blanche and Millie were quite convinced now that their mother was
suffering from a slight attack of sunstroke.</p>
<p>Both the girls were still footsore, and one of Millie&rsquo;s boots
had worn into a hole, but they had a definite objective at last, and
only some ten or twelve miles to travel before reaching it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be there by midday,&rdquo; said Blanche,
hopefully.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, every one was using a new measure of time.

<p class="first">Near Wycombe a woman rose from under the hedge as the
Goslings approached, and came out into the middle of the road. She was
a stout, florid woman, whose age might have been anything between forty
and fifty. Her gait and the droop of her shoulders, rather than the
flaccidity of her rather loose skin, gave her the appearance of being
past middle age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goot morning,&rdquo; she said as the Goslings came up.
&ldquo;If it iss no inconvenience I would like to come with you.&rdquo;
She spoke with a foreign accent, thickening her final consonants and
giving a different value to some of her vowels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Blanche curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that! what does it matter?&rdquo; returned the woman.
&ldquo;I have been living with a farmer&rsquo;s wife further back along
the road there. But she was not company for me. She was common. Now I
see that you and your mother are not common. And I do not care to live
with farmers&rsquo; wives. But where we go? Does it matter? We all go
to find work in the fields&mdash;aristocrat as much as peasant. But iss
it not better that we who are not peasants should go together?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>Millie giggled surreptitiously, and Mrs Gosling appeared conscious
of the fact that some one was addressing them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; &rsquo;ome,&rdquo; she remarked, and
Millie gently prodded her in the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; &rsquo;ome,&rdquo; repeated Mrs Gosling
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach! You are lucky. There are few that have homes now,&rdquo;
replied the strange woman. &ldquo;I had a home, once, how long ago.
Now, during two months, I have no home.&rdquo; She was evidently on the
verge of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s got a touch of the sun,&rdquo; Blanche said in
a low voice, &ldquo;and we have to pretend we&rsquo;re going home. You
needn&rsquo;t tell her we&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; replied the stranger. &ldquo;I am all
that is most discreet, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche hardened her heart. This woman took too much for granted.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s any use your coming with us,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach! we others, we should cling together,&rdquo; said the
stranger, with a large gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re nobody,&rdquo; replied Blanche, curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It iss well to say that. I know. There iss good reason. I,
too, must tell the common people that I am a nobody, I call myself,
even, Mrs Isaacson. But between us there iss no need to say what iss
not true. I can see what you are. Although I am not English, I have
lived many years already in England, and I can see. It iss well that we
cling together? Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; burst out Blanche. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mrs
Isaacson, are you? I&rsquo;ve heard of you.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>For one moment Mrs Isaacson&rsquo;s fine eyes seemed to look inwards
in an instantaneous review of her past. &ldquo;Ach! so! Then we are
friends already,&rdquo; she said cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard of you from Aunt May,&rdquo; said Blanche, and the
faint air of respect with which she pronounced the name did not escape
the notice of the alert Jewess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach! the so dear and so clever Auntie May,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But she iss too kind, and work so hard while her sister do
always nothing. See, I will help you to draw your poor mother who has a
touch of the sun. You and I at the handle and your beautiful sister to
push, while we talk a little of the clever Auntie May. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche had been forewarned. She could only put one construction on
the little she had heard of Mrs Isaacson. But the Jewess&rsquo;s manner
no less than her conversation was subtly flattering. Moreover, she had
made no appeal for help; finally there was a certain urgency about her,
a force of will which Blanche found it difficult to resist. And as the
girl still hesitated Mrs Isaacson bravely seized her side of the trolly
handle and the procession moved on.</p>
<p>The Goslings found a use for her when they came to the drop of
Amersham Hill, going down into High Wycombe. Blanche proposed that Mrs
Gosling should walk down, but the old lady did not seem to understand
her. She looked perplexed and kept saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
remember this road. Are you sure we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; right,
Blanche?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! she must not walk in this heat,&rdquo; put in Mrs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>Isaacson. &ldquo;We three can manage very
well.&rdquo; And, indeed, although she manifestly suffered greatly from
the exertion, the Jewess was of very great assistance in retarding the
speed of the trolly as they made the perilous descent.</p>
<p>After that there could be no question of calmly telling her to go
her own way.</p>
<p>By the time they had crossed the almost deserted town&mdash;at that
hour nearly all the women were either in their houses or working in
gardens and fields&mdash;and had found their way to the Marlow road,
Mrs Isaacson had quite become one of the party, and by no means the
least energetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have something to eat and some milk, when we get
through the town,&rdquo; said Blanche as they faced the long hill up to
Handy Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently, presently,&rdquo; replied the heaving Mrs
Isaacson, as though food were of little importance to her, but
accepting the admission that she had earned the right to share equally
with the others.</p>
<p>Their first burst of energy after they had faced the ascent brought
them to the gates of Wycombe Abbey, and there they decided to rest and
lunch, blissfully ignorant of the long climb which lay before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be nice and quiet here in the shade,&rdquo; suggested
Mrs Isaacson.</p>

<p class="first">The old conventions would not have suffered them to
sit and eat thus under the walls, at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>very gates of Wycombe
Abbey. Their clothes and their boots were wearing badly, and Mrs
Isaacson, at least, was not too clean. It was noticeable, however,
that, despite the dryness of the weather, little dust clung to them.
The surface of the roads had not been pounded and crushed into powder
during the past six weeks by the constant passage of wheeled traffic,
and even in the tracks frequented by farm carts the roads were stained
with green. Indeed, everything was greener than in the old days,
everything was more vigorous. Whether because the year had been
favourable, or because it was relieved from the burden of choking dust
which it had had to endure in other years from May onwards, the
vegetation in hedges and by the wayside appeared to grow more strongly
and with a greater self-assertion. And by contrast with this vigour and
cleanness of plant life, the four women in their tumbled clothes and
untidy hats, feeble and unsightly remnants of forgotten fashion, were
as much out of place as if they had been set down in ancient Greece.
The dowdy foolishness of their apparel marked them out from every other
living thing about them, they were intruders, despoilers of beauty.</p>
<p>Some dim consciousness of this came to Blanche.</p>
<p>They had spoken little as they ate&mdash;Mrs Gosling would touch
nothing but milk, and Mrs Isaacson strove desperately and with some
success to control the greed that showed in the concentrated eagerness
of her eyes and the grasping crook of her fingers&mdash;and when they
had finished, lingering in the relief of the shade, they were still
silent. It seemed as if the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=
"#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>first word spoken must necessarily
hasten the continuation of their journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! bother this old hat,&rdquo; said Blanche at last.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take mine off,&rdquo; and she drew out the
solitary pin which remained to her and cast the hat into the ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do it any good,&rdquo; remarked Millie but
she, too, took off her hat with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to chuck hats,&rdquo; said Blanche.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Isaacson looked doubtful. &ldquo;They are a protection from the
sun,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allie never wore a hat, and she didn&rsquo;t come to any
harm,&rdquo; returned Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Mrs Isaacson, and looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>Millie was running her fingers through the masses of her red-brown
hair, loosening it and lifting it from her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a relief,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;My head
gets so hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mrs Isaacson, &ldquo;and what beautiful hair!
It does not seem right to hide it. I haf a comb in my bag. It is almost
all I haf left. Let me now comb your beautiful hair for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t you bother,&rdquo; said Millie sheepishly,
but she allowed herself to be persuaded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose the
hair-pins,&rdquo; she warned her newly-found lady&rsquo;s maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so funny out here in the open road,&rdquo; giggled
Millie.</p>
<p>Mrs Isaacson&rsquo;s praise was fulsome.</p>
<p>Blanche watched without comment. Mrs Gosling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>was
plunged in meditation. She was involved in an immense problem relating
to the housekeeping at Wisteria Grove. She was debating whether the
lace curtains at the front windows could be washed at home when they
went back.</p>
<p>Suddenly the attention of the three younger women was caught by
unnatural sounds that came from the further side of the wall against
which they were leaning&mdash;sounds of voices, laughing and singing,
the crunch of wheels and the stamping of horses.</p>
<p>The two girls jumped to their feet. Mrs Isaacson rose more
deliberately, with a grunt of expostulation. Mrs Gosling was in a world
far removed and continued to debate her problem.</p>
<p>Millie&rsquo;s hands were fumbling at her hair, and Blanche was
first at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why,
whatever&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody!&rdquo; squealed Millie, still struggling with her
loose mane.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The centre and object of the curious crowd which moved
slowly down the drive was a landau and pair. The horses were decorated
as if for a May-day f&ecirc;te, grotesquely, foolishly decorated with
roses, syringa and buttercups made into shapeless bunches and tied to
the harness. Three or four women walked at the horses&rsquo; heads,
leading them with absurdly beflowered ropes. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>Round the landau a dozen girls and young women were dancing,
chattering, singing, laughing; constantly turning to the occupant of
the carriage, for whose benefit the whole performance was being
conducted. Some of them had their necks and breasts bare, and all
appeared to be frankly shameless. They twisted and danced with clumsy
eagerness, threw themselves about, screamed and shrieked, unaware of
any observer but the one whose notice they were seeking to attract.
They were graceless, civilized savages; Bacchantes who had never known
the beauty of unconscious abandonment. There was the ugliness of
conscious purpose in their every attitude, and no trace of the freedom
that comes from careless rapture.</p>
<p>In the carriage a man and a woman were sitting side by side. The man
was young, with strong claims to physical beauty&mdash;tall,
broad-shouldered, swarthy, with boldly modelled features and heavily
lidded eyes. But his skin was coarse; the bulk of his body was too
gross for clean, muscular strength; his curly, well-oiled hair was
thinning at the temples; his loose mouth leered and gaped. He was
dressed in a suit of broadly-patterned tweed, his great red fingers
were covered with rings, he wore a heavy gold bangle on each thick,
round wrist, and a sweet, frail rose was thrust into his black and
greasy hair.</p>
<p>The woman beside him was the typical courtesan of the ages,
low-browed and full-lipped. Her eyes were eloquent with the subtleties
of love, with invitation, retreat, fear and desire. Had she been
dressed becomingly she would have been beautiful; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>but
she was English and modern, and her great meaningless hat and senseless
garments were of the fashion that had been in vogue just before the
plague. This reigning sultana and her lover were more incongruous in
that setting than the two dishevelled, travel-worn girls, who retreated
timidly to let the landau pass out between the great iron gates.</p>
<p>The Bacchantes eyed the Goslings with obvious disfavour, but the
beauty in the landau seemed unaware of their presence until her
lord&rsquo;s attention was attracted by the sight of Millie&rsquo;s
hair&mdash;it was all down again, rippling and spreading to her
waist.</p>
<p>The young butcher had been lolling back in a corner of his carriage,
magnificently indolent, sure of worship; but his satiety was pierced by
the sight of that flaming mane. He sat up and looked at Millie with the
experienced eyes which had served him so well in his judgment of
cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;alf a jiff,&rdquo; he commanded the nymphs
at his horses&rsquo; bridles, and the carriage was stopped.</p>
<p>Millie, covered with shame, shrank back, and cowered behind Blanche,
who threw up her chin and met the butcher&rsquo;s eyes with all the
contempt of which she was capable&mdash;little enough, perhaps, for
she, too, was weak with unreasoning terror. Behind their backs the
Jewess grimaced her scorn of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of me&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t
goin&rsquo; to &rsquo;urt yer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the butcher,
but his lady interrupted him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221"
href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>Her fine eyes grew bright with anger. &ldquo;If you stop here, I
shall get out,&rdquo; she said, and her inflexion was not that of the
people.</p>
<p>The butcher visibly hesitated. It may be that this chain had held
him too long and was beginning to gall him, but he looked at her and
wavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &rsquo;arm in stoppin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Pass the news an&rsquo; that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going on?&rdquo; demanded the beauty fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; he returned sullenly. &ldquo;You
needen&rsquo; get so blasted &rsquo;uffy about it, old gal. Oh, gow on,
you!&rdquo; he added to the nymphs. &ldquo;Wot the &rsquo;ell are yer
starin&rsquo; at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the landau moved on, he looked back once at Millie.</p>

procession had passed on down the hill towards Wycombe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How he stared at my hair,&rdquo; said Millie, with a giggle.
&ldquo;I did try to get it up, but it&rsquo;s that stubborn with the
heat or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky for us he had that creature with him,&rdquo; commented
Blanche.</p>
<p>Millie assented without fervour. She was bold enough now the danger
had passed.</p>
<p>Mrs Isaacson looked from one to the other and attempted no criticism
of the adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must let me do up your beautiful hair,&rdquo; she said to
the simpering Millie.</p>
<p>Millie was grateful. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> kind of you, Mrs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>Isaacson, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;My hair is a trouble. I sometimes think I&rsquo;ll cut it all
off and be done with it&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She appeared excited and chatted incessantly while the hair-dressing
continued, and Blanche restored the remains of their meal to the
trolly.</p>
<p>With some difficulty they succeeded in getting Mrs Gosling back into
her carriage. She had taken no notice of the procession, but as they
were starting again she awoke from her abstraction to ask: &ldquo;When
d&rsquo;you expect we&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;ome, Blanche? I&rsquo;ve been
thinkin&rsquo; about them curtains in the
drawin&rsquo;-room&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be home in an hour or two, now,&rdquo; Blanche
said, reassuringly. She did not know what a struggle awaited them
before they should top the hill at Handy Cross.</p>
<p>Mrs Isaacson had forsaken her place at the pole. &ldquo;I shall be
able to push more strongly behind,&rdquo; she had said, but despite the
theoretical gain in mechanical advantage obtained by the new
arrangement, the hill seemed never-ending. They had to rest
continually, and always they looked with increasing irritation at the
quiet figure in the trolly, chief cause of their distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe she could walk all right,&rdquo; Millie broke out
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was for a little way, it would help,&rdquo; commented
Mrs Isaacson.</p>
<p>But when Blanche put the proposition to her mother, Mrs Gosling
seemed unable to comprehend it, and pity influenced them to renew the
struggle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>So they toiled on with growing impatience until they reached level
ground again; and presently, looking down over the long slope of the
valley, saw, two miles and a half away, the spire of Marlow Church.</p>
<p>They rested under a hedge for a time, and when they started again
Millie followed her sister&rsquo;s example and discarded her hat.
Blanche, with a certain courage of opinion, had left hers under the
walls of Wycombe Abbey, but Millie&rsquo;s hat found a place in the
trolly.</p>
<p>The ease of the long descent permitted a renewal of conversation,
and Mrs Isaacson and Millie talked in undertones as they made their way
down towards Marlow. Blanche took little notice of them; she was
struggling perplexedly with the problems of life. Mrs Gosling&rsquo;s
presence was negligible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very handsome fellow in the carriage,&rdquo;
remarked Mrs Isaacson suddenly, &ldquo;I think you do well not to go
near that place again.&rdquo; Her fine eyes fixedly regarded the broad,
rusty back of Mrs Gosling and the broken ribs of her umbrella.</p>
<p>Millie simpered. &ldquo;Oh! I should be safe enough. His
wife&rsquo;d see to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was not his wife,&rdquo; returned Mrs Isaacson.
&ldquo;Men would not marry now that they are so few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! there&rsquo;s a thing to say!&rdquo; exclaimed Millie
on a note of expostulation, interested nevertheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It iss true,&rdquo; continued Mrs Isaacson. &ldquo;I haf
heard of this handsome young fellow. He iss a butcher, and he goes
every day to kill the sheep and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"
href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>cows, because the women do
not like that work. And he iss very strong, and clever also. He teach a
few of the women how to cut up the sheep and the cows. And he iss much
admired, it iss of course, by all the young women; but he does not
marry because he is one man among so many women, and it would not be
right that he should love only one, for so there would be so few
children and the world would die. Yes! But he has for a time one who
iss favourite, for another time another favourite. And that iss why I
warn you not to return. Because I see that he admire your so beautiful
hair. And I see that if you had not been so modest and so good, and
hide behind your sister, he would have come down from his carriage and
put you up there beside him. And he would have said to that bold ugly
woman. &lsquo;Go, I tire of you, I will haf beside me this one who iss
young and beautiful and has hair of gold.&rsquo; It iss not safe for
you, there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I say,&rdquo; commented Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It iss true,&rdquo; nodded Mrs Isaacson, with intensest
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, thank goodness, I&rsquo;m not one of that
sort,&rdquo; said Millie, warm in the knowledge of her virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly not,&rdquo; assented Mrs Isaacson. &ldquo;You must not
be displeased that I warn you. It iss not your goodness that I doubt.
It iss that this man iss so powerful. He iss able to do what he wishes.
He iss a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody!&rdquo; was the mark of surprise with which Millie
punctuated this remarkable piece of information, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>and
for several yards they trudged on in silence.</p>
<p>But Millie soon revived this fascinating subject by saying
thoughtfully, &ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t catch me over there
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly not. It iss not wise,&rdquo; agreed Mrs Isaacson, and
proceeded to enlarge upon Millie&rsquo;s dangerous beauty.</p>
<p>It was a topic entirely new to Millie. She simpered and giggled,
disclaimed her attractions, protested that Mrs Isaacson was
&ldquo;getting at&rdquo; her, and became so absorbed in the fascination
of her disavowal that she forgot her weariness, her tender
feet&mdash;naked to the road in two places&mdash;and all her
discouragements. She walked with a more conscious air, straightening
her back and lifting her head. The blood moved more freely in her
veins, and she presently became so vivacious in her replies that
Blanche was aroused to a sense of something unfamiliar. She checked the
trolly and looked back at her sister, past the quiet brooding figure of
Mrs Gosling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mill?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! nothing!&rdquo; replied Millie. &ldquo;We were just
talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seem to be enjoying yourselves,&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were saying that we shall soon now arrive at some place
where we can rest. Yes?&rdquo; put in Mrs Isaacson, and thus
established a ground of confidence between herself and Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps. I dunno!&rdquo; returned Blanche. She sighed
and looked round her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the fields between them and Marlow they could see here and there
little figures stooping and straightening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&rdquo; exclaimed Millie, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another man,&rdquo; said Millie, pointing.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better scoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they made no attempt to put such an impossible plan into action.
The man had evidently seen them. He was coming towards them across one
of the fields, shouting to attract their attention. &ldquo;Hi! wait a
minute!&rdquo; they thought he was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mill!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche, with extraordinary
emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Millie, nervously. She was flushed and
trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see who it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the one out of the
carriage&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; hesitated Millie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No!</i> Silly. It&rsquo;s that young fellow who used to
live with us, our Mr Fastidious. What was his name? Thrale! You
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody!&rdquo; said Millie. She was conscious of a quite
inexplicable feeling of disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He iss a friend? Yes?&rdquo; asked Mrs Isaacson. <span class=

<p class="first">The history of mankind is the history of human law.
The larger ordinances of the universe are commonly referred to some
superior lawgiver, under such names as God and physico-chemical action;
names which appear mutually subversive only to the bigot, whether
theologian or biologist. These larger ordinances sometimes appear
inflexible, as in the domain of physics and chemistry, sometimes
empirical as in the development of species, but we may believe that if
they change at all, the period of change is so great as to be outside
any possibility of observation by a few thousand generations of
mankind.</p>
<p>Human law, on the other hand, is tentative, without sound precedent
and in its very nature mutable. In our miserably limited record of
history, that paltry ten thousand years which is but a single tick of
the cosmic watch, we have been unable to formulate any overruling law
to which other laws are subject. Climate, race and condition impose
certain limitations, and within that enceinte civilizations have
developed a system of rules, increasing always in complexity, and have
then failed to maintain their place in the competitive struggle. It has
been rashly suggested that the overriding law of laws <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>is
that rigidity is fatal to the nation. An analogy has been found in the
growth of the child. Here and there some bold spirit has ventured the
daring hypothesis that if a young child be confined within a perfectly
fitting iron shell he will not grow. Such speculations, however, do not
appeal to mankind as a whole. Perhaps the truth of the matter is that
nothing appals us so much as the idea that man is capable of growth. Is
it not inconceivable that any race of men could be wiser, more perfect
than ourselves?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, out of all vague speculation one deliciously certain
axiom presents itself, namely that mankind cannot live without law of
some kind. The most primitive savage has his ordinances. The least
primary concussion of individuals develops a rule of practice, whether
it takes such diverse forms as &ldquo;hit first,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;present the other cheek&rdquo;; although the latter rule has not
yet been developed beyond the stage of theory.</p>
<p>In the unprecedented year of the new plague, the old rules were
thrown into the melting pot, but within three months humanity was
evolving precedents for a new statute book. The concussions of these
three months were fierce and destructive. Women, in the face of death,
killed and stole in the old primitive ways, unhampered now by the
necessity to kill and steal according to the tedious rules of
twentieth-century civilization, rules that women had never been foolish
enough to reverence in the letter. All those complex and
incomprehensible laws had been made by men for men, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>after the plague there was none to administer
them, for no women and few men had ever had the least idea what the law
was. Even the lawgivers themselves had had to wait for the
pronouncement of some prejudiced or unprejudiced judge. Women had long
known what our Bumbles can only learn by bitter experience, inspired to
vision in some moment of fury or desolation.</p>
<p>But within three months of the first great exodus of women from the
town, one dominant law was being brought to birth. It was not written
on tables of stone, nor incorporated in any swollen, dyspeptic book of
statutes; it was not formulated by logic, nor was it the outcome of
serious thought by any individual or by a solemn committee. The law
rose into recognition because it was a necessity for the life of the
majority, and although that majority was not compact, had no common
deliberate purpose, and had never formulated their demand in precise
language, the new law came into being before harvest and was accepted
by all but a small resentful minority of aristocrats and landowners, as
a supreme ordinance, indisputably just.</p>
<p>This law was that every woman had a right to her share in the bounty
of Nature, and the corollary was that she earned her right by
labour.</p>
<p>In those days the justice of the principle was perfectly obvious; so
obvious, indeed, that the law came to birth without the obstetric skill
of any parliament whatever. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is now impossible to say why such different types
of male humanity as Jasper Thrale, George Gosling or the Bacchus of
Wycombe Abbey escaped the plague. The bacillus (surely a strangely
individual type, it must have been) was never isolated, nor the
pathology of the disease investigated. The germ was some new
unprecedented growth which ran through a fierce cycle of development
within a few months, changed its nature as it swarmed into every corner
of the earth, and finally expired more quickly than it had come into
being.</p>
<p>If the male survivors in Europe and the East had been of one type,
some theory might be formulated to account for their immunity; but so
far as science can pronounce an opinion, the living male residue can
only be explained by the doctrine of chances. A few escaped, by
accident. In the British Isles there may have been 1,500 men who thus
survived. In the whole of Europe, besides, there were less than a
thousand. It seems probable that even before Scotland was attacked the
climax had been reached; by the time the plague reached England the
first faint evidences of a decline in virulence may be
marked&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>From the first, Jasper Thrale ventured his life without an
afterthought. He was fearless by nature. He did not lack those powers
of imagination which are commonly supposed to add so greatly to the
terror of death, he simply lacked the feeling of fear. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>In
all his life he had never experienced that sickness of apprehension
which dissolves our fibre into a quivering jelly&mdash;as though the
spirit had already withdrawn from the trembling inertia of the flesh.
Perhaps Thrale&rsquo;s spirit was too dominant for such retreat, was
more completely master of its material than is the spirit of the common
man. For the spirit cannot know bodily fear, it is the apprehensive
flesh that wilts and curdles at the approach of danger. And it is
worthy of notice that in the old days, up to the early twentieth
century, these rare cases of fearlessness in individuals were more
often found among women than among men.</p>
<p>Thrale, with his perfectly careless courage, found plenty of work
for himself in London during May and early June. He acted as a
scavenger, and still went far afield with his burial cart long after
every trace of living male humanity had disappeared from the streets of
London.</p>
<p>Then one day, at the end of June, he realized that his task was
futile, and it came to him that there was work awaiting him of more
importance than this purification of streets which might never again
echo to the traffic of humanity.</p>
<p>So he chose the best bicycle he could find in Holborn Viaduct,
stripped a relay of four tyres from other machines, and with these and
a reserve of food made into a somewhat cumbrous parcel, he set out to
explore the new world.</p>
<p>He took the Bath Road, intending to make exploration of the fertile
West Country. He had Cornish blood in his veins, and his ultimate goal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>was the county which had almost escaped
urbanization. As he then visualized the problem, it appeared that life
would offer greater possibilities in such places.</p>
<p>But before he reached Colnbrook, he had recognized that work was
required of him nearer home. The exodus was then in progress. He came
through armies of helpless women and children flying from starvation;
women who had no object in view save that of escape to the country;
&ldquo;Silly Londoners&rdquo; with no knowledge of how food was to be
obtained when their goal was reached.</p>
<p>He did not stay there, however. He was beginning to see the outline
of his plan, and at the same time the limitation of his own powers. He
saw that enough food could not be raised near London to support the
multitude, that the death of the many was demanded by the needs of the
few if any were to survive, and that communities must be formed with
the common purpose of tilling the land and excluding those who could
not earn their right to support. In such a catastrophe as this, charity
became a crime.</p>
<p>He intended even then to push on beyond Reading, but in Maidenhead
he met a woman who influenced him to a nearer goal.</p>

<p class="first">She stepped into the road and held up her hand.</p>
<p>Thrale stopped; he thought she was about to make the familiar demand
either for food or a direction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235"
href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;To find room,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is room for you near here,&rdquo; said the woman,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Machinery, harvesting machinery, agricultural machinery of
all sorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Thrale.</p>
<p>She dropped her voice and looked about her. &ldquo;Marlow,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s an eddy. Off the main roads and by
the river. There are less than a thousand women there at present, and
we are keeping the others out; at least until after harvest. There is
plenty of land about, and we&rsquo;re keeping ourselves at present.
Only we <i>do</i> want a man for the machines. Will you come and help
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and see what I can do,&rdquo; said Thrale
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t promise to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there any other men, there?&rdquo; he added
after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One at Wycombe,&rdquo; said the women. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
butcher, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And meanwhile you might help me,&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;I come over here with a horse and cart to raid the
seedsmen&rsquo;s shops. If we leave them the women would eat all the
beans and peas and things, you know; enough to feed us for the winter
gone in a week, and no one any the better. Isn&rsquo;t it awful how
careless we are?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href=

<p class="first">She was a fair, clear-eyed girl, with the figure and
complexion of one who had devoted considerable attention to outdoor
sports. She was wearing a man&rsquo;s Norfolk jacket (men&rsquo;s
clothing was so plentiful), and a skirt that barely reached her knees,
and did not entirely hide cloth knickerbockers which might also have
been adapted from a man&rsquo;s garment. Below the knickerbockers she
displayed thick stockings and sandals. Her splendid fair hair furnished
sufficient protection for her head, and she had dressed a pillow of it
into the nape of her neck as a shield for the sun.</p>
<p>Thrale looked at her with a frank curiosity as they made their way
up the town to a seedsman&rsquo;s shop. She had left the horse and cart
there, she explained, while she explored other streets of the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eileen, of Marlow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be another Eileen there, so one name&rsquo;s
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that how your community feel about it?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re beginning,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He pondered that for a time, and then asked, &ldquo;Who <i>were</i>
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said Thrale. &ldquo;Never did much
so far as I was concerned, but I have a memory of having seen your
photographs in the illustrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237"
href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>papers. I was wondering
whether you had been actress, peeress, scandal; or perhaps all
three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the eldest daughter of the late Duke
of Hertford,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the ci-devant Lady Eileen Ferrar,
citizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, was that it?&rdquo; replied Thrale carelessly.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s this shop of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The loot was heavier than Eileen had anticipated. The shop had been
ransacked, but they found an untouched store, containing such valuables
as beans, potatoes and a few small sacks of turnip seed at the bottom
of a yard. When these had been placed in the cart, they decided that
the load was sufficient for one horse.</p>
<p>They took the longer road to Marlow, through Bourne End, to avoid
the hill. Eileen walked at the horse&rsquo;s head, with Thrale beside
her wheeling his bicycle, and during those two hours he learnt much of
the little community which he proposed to serve for a time.</p>
<p>It seemed that in Marlow&mdash;and the same thing must have happened
in a hundred other small towns throughout the country&mdash;a few women
had taken control of the community. These women were of all classes and
the committee included an Earl&rsquo;s widow, a national
schoolmistress, a small green-grocer, and an unmarried woman of
property living half a mile out of the town. These women had worked
together in an eminently practical way; at first to relieve distress,
and then to plan the future. They had wasted little time in discussions
among themselves&mdash;none of them had the parliamentary sense
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>of the uses of debate. When they had disagreed,
they had had plenty of scope to carry out varying methods within their
own spheres of influence.</p>
<p>Their first and most difficult task had been to teach the members of
their community to work for the common good, and that task was by no
means perfected as yet. Co-operation was agreeable enough to those who
had nothing to lose, but the women in temporary possession of the
sources of food supply were not so easily convinced. In many instances
the committee&rsquo;s arguments had been suddenly clenched by an
exposition of <i lang="fr">force majeure</i>, and property owners had
discovered to their amazement that they had no remedy.</p>
<p>But the head and leader of Marlow was a farmer&rsquo;s daughter of
nineteen, a certain Carrie Oliver. Her father had had a small farm in
the Chilterns not far from Fingest. He had been a lazy, drunken
creature, and from the time Carrie had left the national school she had
practically carried on the work of the farm single handed. She liked
the work; the interest of it absorbed her.</p>
<p>The Marlow schoolmistress had remembered her when the committee had
first faced the daunting task of providing for the future. They had
been more or less capable of organizing a majority of the women, but no
member of the committee knew the secrets of agriculture and
stock-breeding, and in all Marlow and the neighbourhood no woman had
been found who was capable of instructing them in all that was
necessary.</p>
<p>A deputation of three had been sent to Fingest, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>and
had discovered Miss Oliver in the midst of plenty, cultivating her farm
in comfort now that she had been relieved of her father&rsquo;s
unwelcome presence.</p>
<p>She had been covered with confusion when requested to leave her
retreat and take command of a town and the surrounding twenty thousand
acres or so within reach of the new community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she had said, blushing and ducking
her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough; I&rsquo;ll tell you if
there&rsquo;s anything you want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deputation had then put the case very clearly before her,
pointing out that in Miss Oliver&rsquo;s hands lay the future of a
thousand lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear. I dunno. What can <i>I</i> do?&rdquo; Carrie had
said, and when the deputation had urged that she should return with
them and take charge forthwith, she had replied that that was quite
impossible, that there were the cows to milk, the calves, pigs and
chickens to feed, and goodness knew how many other necessary things to
be done before sunset.</p>
<p>The deputation had said that cows, calves, horses, sheep, pigs and
chickens might and should be transferred forthwith to the neighbourhood
of Marlow.</p>
<p>It had taken three days to convince her, Eileen said, and added,
&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s splendid, now. It&rsquo;s wonderful what a lot
she knows; and she rides about on a horse everywhere and sees to
everything. The difficulty is to stop her getting down and doing the
work herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale understood that, exceptional male as he was, his position in
Marlow would be subordinate to that of Miss Oliver. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she understand agricultural machinery?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; returned Eileen. &ldquo;But she hasn&rsquo;t
time, you see, to attend to all that, and it&rsquo;s so jolly difficult
to learn. I&rsquo;ve been doing a bit. I&rsquo;m better at it than most
of &rsquo;em. But when I saw you it struck me how ripping it would be
if you&rsquo;d come and take over that side. Men are so jolly good at
machinery. We shouldn&rsquo;t miss them much if it weren&rsquo;t for
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">After a marked preliminary hesitation the committee
appointed Jasper Thrale chief mechanic of Marlow. The hesitation was
understandable. Their only experience of the ways of men in this
altered civilization had been drawn from observations of Mr Evans at
Wycombe. His manner of life appeared representative of what they might
expect. Nevertheless they did not openly condemn him, although he
proved an immediate source of trouble, even to these organizers in
Marlow. The youth of the place was apt to wander over the hill in the
evenings; &ldquo;just for fun,&rdquo; they said. They went in twos and
threes, and occasionally one of them stayed behind. These evening walks
interfered with work. &ldquo;Later on I shouldn&rsquo;t mind so
much,&rdquo; Lady Durham had said, commenting on the loss of a young
and active worker, &ldquo;but there is so much to do just now.&rdquo;
Her comment showed that even then the situation was being accepted, and
that many women were prepared to adapt their old opinions to new
conditions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>It also showed why the committee hesitated to
accept Thrale&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>Thrale understood their difficulty, and went straight to the
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are afraid that the young women will be wasting time,
running after me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Set your minds at rest. That
won&rsquo;t last. And if you give me pupils for my machinery I should
prefer women over forty in any case. I believe I shall find them more
capable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right in one way. When the excitement of his coming had
subsided, he was not the cause of much wasted time. He adopted a manner
with the younger women which did not encourage advances. He was, in
fact, quite brutally frank. When the young women devised all kinds of
impossible excuses to linger in his vicinity he sent them away with hot
indignant faces. Among those who sought their sterile amusements in
Wycombe it became the fashion openly to express hatred and contempt for
&ldquo;that engine fellow.&rdquo; It was agreed that he
&ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t a proper man.&rdquo; Another section, however,
talked scandal, and hinted that assistant-engineer Eileen was the cause
of Thrale&rsquo;s pretended misogyny.</p>
<p>The committee found their work more complicated in some respects
after Thrale&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Thrale, himself, was supremely indifferent to any scandal or
expression of hatred. He had his hands full, his hours of work were
only limited by daylight, and six hours sleep was all he asked for or
desired. After a very brief introduction to the intricacies of reaper
and rake at the hands of Miss Oliver&mdash;her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>father had never been able to afford a binder,
but the days of corn-harvest were still far ahead&mdash;he set himself
to learn the mysteries of all the agricultural machinery in the
neighbourhood; traction engines, steam ploughs and thrashing machines,
and to pass on the knowledge he gained to his pupils. He found them
stupid at first, but they were patient and willing for the most
part.</p>
<p>Then, handicapped by the lack of coal, he rode over to Bourne End
and discovered two locomotives. One of them was standing on the line a
mile out of the station with a full complement of coaches attached, the
other was an unencumbered goods engine in a siding. He chose the latter
for his first experiment, and succeeded in driving it back to Marlow.
It groaned and screamed in a way that indicated serious organic
trouble, but after he had overhauled it, it proved capable of taking
him to Maidenhead, where he found a sound engine in a shed.</p>
<p>After that he devoted three days to getting a clear line to
Paddington, a tedious process which involved endless descents from the
cab, and mountings into signal boxes, experiments with levers and the
occasional necessity for pushing whole trains out of his path into some
siding. But at last he returned with magnificent loot of coal from the
almost untouched London yards beyond Ealing.</p>
<p>London was still the storehouse of certain valuable commodities.</p>
<p>His passage through the surrounding country was hailed with cries of
amazement and jubilant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>acclamation. The first railway
surely excited less astonishment than did Thrale on his solitary
engine. Doubtless the unfortunate women who saw him pass believed that
the gods of machinery had returned once more to bring relief from all
the burden of misery and unfamiliar work.</p>
<p>And once the points were set and the way open to London by rail he
could go and return with tools and many other necessaries that had
offered no temptation to the starving multitude who had fled from the
town.</p>
<p>Marlow was greatly blessed among the communities in those days.</p>

<p class="first">The harvest was early that year, and Miss Oliver
decided to cut certain fields of barley at the end of July.</p>
<p>Thrale&rsquo;s energies were then diverted to the superintendence of
the reapers and binders, and he rode from field to field, overlooking
the work of his pupils or spending furious hours in struggle with some
refractory mechanism.</p>
<p>One Saturday, an hour or two after midday, he was returning from
some such struggle, when he saw a strange procession coming down that
long hill from Handy Cross, which some pious women regarded as the road
to hell.</p>
<p>Casual immigration had almost ceased by that time, but the sight
indicated the necessity for immediate action. The immigration laws of
Marlow, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>though not coded as yet, were strict; and only
bona fide workers were admitted, and even those were critically
examined.</p>
<p>Thrale shouted to attract attention and the procession stopped.</p>
<p>When he came through the gate on to the road, he was accosted by
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Thrale, fancy finding you,&rdquo; said the young woman
at the pole of the truck.</p>
<p>The meeting of Livingstone and Stanley was far less amazing.</p>
<p>An old woman perched on the truck and partly sheltered by the
remains of an umbrella, regarded his appearance with some show of
displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By rights &rsquo;e should &rsquo;ave written to me in the
first place,&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s got a touch of the sun,&rdquo; explained
Blanche hurriedly.</p>
<p>Thrale had not yet spoken. He was considering the problem of whether
he owed any duty to these wanderers, which could override his duty to
Marlow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Blanche and Millie explained volubly, by turns and together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we don&rsquo;t let anyone stay here,&rdquo; said
Thrale.</p>
<p>Blanche&rsquo;s eyebrows went up and she waved her too exuberant
sister aside. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re willing to work,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother?&rdquo; queried Thrale. &ldquo;And this other
woman?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach! I work too,&rdquo; put in Mrs Isaacson. &ldquo;I have
learnt all that is necessary for the farm. I milk and feed chickens and
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come before the committee,&rdquo; said
Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere out of the sun,&rdquo; replied Blanche, &ldquo;and
somewhere where we can put mother. She&rsquo;s very bad, I&rsquo;m
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can stay to-night, anyway,&rdquo; returned Thrale.</p>
<p>Millie made a face at him behind his back, and whispered to Mrs
Isaacson, who pursed her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you do seem more civilized here,&rdquo; remarked
Blanche as the procession restarted towards Marlow. Thrale, with
something of the air of a policeman, was walking by the side of the
pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come at a good time,&rdquo; was his only
comment.</p>
<p>Millie had another shock before they reached the town. She saw what
she thought was a second man, on horseback this time, coming towards
them. Marlow, she thought, was evidently a place to live in. But the
figure was only that of Miss Oliver in corduroy trousers, riding
astride.</p>

<p class="first">Fate had dropped the Goslings into Buckinghamshire to
fulfil their destiny. They had been led to Marlow by a casual
direction, here and there, after the first propulsion of
Blanche&rsquo;s instinct had sent them into the country beyond Harrow.
And fate, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>doubtless with some incomprehensible purpose of
its own in view, had quietly decided that in Marlow they were to stay.
They had been dropped at a season when, for the first time in the long
three months&rsquo; history of the community, there was a shortage of
labour; and Blanche and Millie, browned by exposure and generally
improved by their first six days of healthy life, were quite acceptable
additions to the population at that moment. As for Mrs Isaacson, a lady
of sufficient initiative and force of character to require no kindly
interposition of Providence on her behalf, she arranged her own future
as an expert of farm management, and incidentally as the
Goslings&rsquo; housemate. Mrs Isaacson was a burr that would stick
anywhere for a time. She displayed an unexpected and highly specialized
knowledge of the management of farms, when confronted with the expert
Miss Oliver who was far too embarrassed to press her questions home.
The casual remarks of Aunt May and her helpers had been retained in Mrs
Isaacson&rsquo;s brilliant memory and she displayed her knowledge to
the best possible advantage, filling the gaps with irrelevant
volubility, gesture and histrionic struggles with the English language,
which proved suddenly inadequate to the expression of these recondities
that the German would have so aptly expressed. It was inferred that in
her native Bavaria, Mrs Isaacson had farmed in the grand style.</p>
<p>Only Mrs Gosling, useless and ineligible, remained for
consideration, and she for once took a firm line of her own, and defied
the committee, Marlow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href=
"#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>generally, and the negligible
remainder of the cosmos, to alter her determination.</p>
<p>The home at which they had finally arrived did not suit her. The
tiny cottage of three rooms in the little street that runs down to the
town landing stage had no lace curtains in the front window, no suites
of furniture, no hall to save the discreet caller from stepping through
the front door straight into the single living-room, no accumulation of
dustable ornaments, not even a strip of carpet or linoleum to cover the
nakedness of a bricked floor. It was not civilized; it was not decent
according to the refined standards of Wisteria Grove; it was an
impossible place for any respectable woman to live in, and Mrs Gosling,
with unexpected force of character, chose the obvious alternative. She
did not, however, make any announcement of her determination; she was
wrapped in a speculative depression that found no relief in words. She
had been so ordered, hoisted, dragged and bumped through the detested
country during the past six days that all show of authority had been
taken from her. It may be that deep in her own mind she cherished a
sullen and enduring resentment against her daughters, and had vowed to
take the last and unanswerable revenge of which humanity is capable.
But outwardly she preserved that air of incomprehension which had
marked her during the last stages of their journey, and committed
herself to no statement of the enormous plan which must have been
forming in her mind.</p>
<p>When they took her into the small, brick-paved <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>room
and deposited her temporarily on a wooden-seated chair, while they
unpacked what <span class="corr" id="xd26e4225" title=
"Source: remainded">remained</span> to them in the accursed trolly, Mrs
Gosling took one brief but comprehensive survey of her naked
surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bit touched, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; whispered
Millie to her sister. &ldquo;Do you think she understands where we are
or what we&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche shook her head. &ldquo;I expect she&rsquo;ll be all right in
a day or two,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls, stirred to a new outlook on life by the extraordinary
experiences of the past months, were on the threshold of diverse
adventures. After the toil and anxiety of their tramp through
inhospitable country, and the hazard of the open air, this reception
into a community and settlement into a permanent shelter afforded a
relief which was too unexpected to be qualified as yet by criticism, or
any comparison with past glories. They were young and plastic, and to
each of them the future seemed to hold some promise; to them the
silence and immobility of their mother could only be evidence of
impaired faculties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get her to bed,&rdquo; said Blanche.</p>
<p>Even when Mrs Gosling asked with perfect relevance, &ldquo;Are we
going to stop &rsquo;ere, Blanche?&rdquo; they humoured her with
evasive replies. &ldquo;Well, for a day or two, perhaps,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Look here, don&rsquo;t you worry about that. We&rsquo;re going
to put you to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head dropped again and she fell back into her moody silence.
Doubtless she meditated on the many wrongs her daughters had done her,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>wondered why she should have been brought out to
die in this wilderness?</p>
<p>During the nine days that elapsed before her plan matured, she made
no further comment on her surroundings. She lay in the upstairs room,
sleeping little, with no desire ever again to face the terror of a
world which demanded a new mode of thought. Unconsciously she had
adopted Blanche&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s
different,&rdquo; but to her the message was one of doom, she could not
live in a different world.</p>
<p>And Blanche on her side was puzzled at her mother&rsquo;s apathy and
said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo; Yet both the changed
conditions and Mrs Gosling&rsquo;s unchangeable habit were fundamental
things. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Marlow that year harvesting and thrashing were
carried on simultaneously. August was very dry, and the greater part of
the corn was never stacked at all. Thrale took his engines into the
fields, and the shocks were loaded on to carts and fed directly into
the thrasher. This method entailed some disadvantages, chief among them
the retarding of the actual harvest-work, but on the whole it probably
economized labour. The scheme would doubtless have been impracticable
in the days of small private ownership, but it worked well in this
instance, favoured as it was by the drought.</p>
<p>The saving of labour during those six weeks of furious toil was a
matter of the first importance. The work, indeed, was too heavy for
many of the women who were unable to stand the physical strain of
hoisting sheaves from the waggons into the thrasher; and the sacks of
grain proved so unmanageable that Thrale had to devise a makeshift
hoist for loading them into the carts. In Marlow, at least, machinery
was still triumphant, and the committee sighed their relief in the
sentence: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we should have done without
Jasper Thrale.&rdquo; Nevertheless it is quite certain that they would
have done without him if it had not been for that fortuitous meeting in
Maidenhead. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>For Thrale there was no rest possible, even when the last field had
been cleared and the last clumsily-built stack of straw or unthrashed
corn erected. Besides the necessity for some form of
thatching&mdash;or, failing efficiency in that direction, for
completing the thrashing operations&mdash;he had to turn his attention
to the immensely difficult problem of turning the grain into flour. He
knew vaguely that the grain ought to be cleaned and conditioned before
grinding, and that the actual separation of the constituents of the
berry was a matter of importance; but he had no practical knowledge of
the various operations, and in this matter Miss Oliver was quite unable
to help him.</p>
<p>The mill beside the lock presented itself as an intricate and
enormously detailed problem which must be solved by a concentrated
effort of induction. The only person who appeared to be of real
assistance to him was Eileen, and she was apt to tire and fall into
despair when the detail of involved and often concealed machinery
baffled them for hour after hour. Nevertheless Thrale solved this
problem also. His first concern was for a head of water. The weirs had
not been touched since the beginning of May, and the river was very
low, but by mid-September there was enough water to work for a few
hours every day, and, despite endless mistakes and setbacks, the mill
was turning out a sufficient supply of fairly respectable looking
flour.</p>
<p>Thrale had that wonderful masculine faculty for thus applying
himself to a mechanical problem, and, like his predecessors in
mechanical invention, it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=
"#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>the problem and not any promise of
future reward which interested him. He became absorbed for the time in
that problem of grinding corn, grudging the hours he was obliged to
devote to other activities; and when he felt the throb of life running
through the mill, saw the women he had taught attending each to their
own appointed task in the economy, and felt the touch of the fine,
smooth flour between his fingers, he needed no thanks from the
committee nor promise of independence to reward him for his labour. The
sight of this thing he had created was sufficient recompense. He loved
this beautiful efficient toy that changed wheat into flour, and oats
into meal, it was his to father and to fight for; the perfect child of
his ingenuity and toil.</p>
<p>But if Thrale&rsquo;s time was tremendously occupied the women found
that they had more opportunities for leisure after harvest. They were
still employed in field and garden, and there was still much to be
done, but their hours were shorter and the work seemed light in
contrast with the heroic labour that had been necessary at the
harvest.</p>
<p>And with this first coming of comparative ease, this first
opportunity for reflection since the terrible plague had thrust upon
them the necessity for fierce and unremitting effort to produce the
essentials of life, women began to express themselves in their various
ways. Aspirations and emotions that had been crushed by the fatigues of
physical labour began to revive; personal inclinations, jealousies and
resentments became manifest in the detail of intercourse; old
prejudices, religious and social, once <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>more assumed an
aspect of importance in the interactions of individuals. There was a
faint stir in the community, the first sign of a trouble which was
steadily to increase as winter laid its bond upon the storehouses of
earth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The two Goslings, working only six or seven hours a
day in the mill during the latter part of September, found plenty of
time for chatter and speculation. They, and more especially Blanche,
had shown themselves capable workers in the harvest field, but when
hands had been required in his mill Thrale had chosen the Goslings and
those whom he considered less adapted to field work; and among them Mrs
Isaacson and a member of the committee, Miss Jenkyn, the
schoolmistress. (The education problem was in abeyance for the time
being. The children had run wild for three months, and been subject
only to the discipline of their mothers, but it was understood that the
children were to receive attention when the winter brought
opportunity.)</p>
<p>Blanche soon distinguished herself as a picked worker in this
sphere. Her intelligence was of a somewhat more masculine quality in
some respects than that of the average woman; she was slower, more
detailed, more logical in her methods. And now that those male
characteristics&mdash;so often deplored by women in the days before the
plague&mdash;had been withdrawn from the flux of life, it had become
evident that they had been an essential part <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>of
the whole, if only a part. Masculine characteristics were at a premium
in Marlow that autumn, and as a natural consequence were being rated at
an ever higher value. There was a tendency among some women to become
more male&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Millie, however, was not among the progressives. She was not gifted
intellectually; she had no swift intuitions&mdash;such as Eileen
had&mdash;which enabled her to comprehend her work; she was naturally
indolent, and all her emotions came to her through sensation.</p>
<p>When she was put to work in the mill she was secretly elated. She
did not believe the stories told of Jasper Thrale&rsquo;s insensibility
to feminine attractions, and if she believed those other stories which
coupled his name with that of Lady Eileen, Millie was of opinion that
such an entanglement was not necessarily final.</p>
<p>The first week of her association with Thrale in the work of the
mill brought disillusionment.</p>
<p>When she looked up from her work and caught his eye as he passed
her, he either stared coldly or stopped and asked in a businesslike,
austere voice whether she wanted assistance. Such intimations should
have been sufficient, but in this thing, at least, Millie was
persistent. She thought that he did not understand&mdash;men were
proverbially stupid in these matters. So she waited for an opportunity
and within ten days one was presented.</p>
<p>A hesitation in some of the machinery she overlooked provided
sufficient excuse for calling the head engineer. She looked down the
step-ladder <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>which communicated with the floor below and
called hesitatingly, &ldquo;Oh! Please. Mr Thrale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard her and looked up, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something gone wrong,&rdquo; she said blushing,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stopped the rollers, but I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; he returned, and
presently joined her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he remarked as he began to examine the
machine, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Mister,&rsquo; now. I thought
you&rsquo;d learnt that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie simpered. &ldquo;It sounds so familiar not to,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; grunted Thrale. &ldquo;You can call me
&lsquo;engineer,&rsquo; I suppose?<span class="corr" id="xd26e4309"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;do you see this
hopper in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came close to him and peered into the machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gets clogged, do you see?&rdquo; said Thrale, &ldquo;and
when the meal stutters you&rsquo;ve just got to put your hand in and
clear it. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; hesitated Millie. She was leaning against
him and her body was trembling with delicious excitement. Almost
unconsciously she pressed a little closer.</p>
<p>Thrale suddenly drew back. &ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo; he said
harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-yes, I think so,&rdquo; returned Millie; and she
straightened herself, looked up at him for a moment and then dropped
her eyes, blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Thrale, &ldquo;and here&rsquo;s
another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>piece of advice for you. If you want to stay in
the mill keep your attention on your work. You&rsquo;re a man now, for
all intents and purposes; you&rsquo;ve got a man&rsquo;s work to do,
and you must keep your mind on it. If there&rsquo;s any foolishness you
go out into the turnip fields. You won&rsquo;t have another
warning,&rdquo; he concluded as he turned and left her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beast,&rdquo; muttered Millie when she was alone. She was
shaken with furious anger. &ldquo;I hate you, you silly stuck up
thing,&rdquo; she whispered fiercely shaking with passion. &ldquo;Oh, I
wish you only knew how I hate you. I won&rsquo;t touch your beastly
machines again. I&rsquo;d sooner a million times be out in the turnip
field than in the same mill with <i>you</i>, you stuck up beast. I
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> work, I won&rsquo;t do a thing,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time she was hysterical.</p>
<p>Blanche coming down from the floor above found her sister tearing at
her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Mill, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Millie had passed through the worst stages of her seizure by then,
and she dropped her hands. &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this beastly mill, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; returned Blanche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said Millie, full of scorn for
Blanche&rsquo;s frigidity. &ldquo;You ought to have been a man, you
ought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno what&rsquo;s come to you,&rdquo; was Blanche&rsquo;s
comment.</p>

<p class="first">It was maturity that had come to Millie. Her new life
of air and physical exercise had set the blood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>running in her veins. In the Wisteria Grove days
she had had an an&aelig;mic tendency; the limited routine of her
existence and all the suppressions of her narrow life had retarded her
development. Now she was suddenly ripe. Two months of sun and air had
brought superabundant vitality, and the surplus had become the most
important factor in her existence<span class="corr" id="xd26e4361"
title="Not in source">.</span> She found no outlet for her new vigour
in the work of the mill. Something within her was crying out for joy.
She wanted to find expression.</p>
<p>There were many other young women in Marlow that autumn in similar
case, and a rumour was current among them that this was a favourable
time for crossing the hill. It was said that the lord of Wycombe was
seeking new favourites.</p>
<p>Millie heard the rumour and tossed her head superciliously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him come here. I&rsquo;d give him a piece of my
mind,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t come &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; returned the gossip.
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s afeard of our Mr Thrale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Jasper Thrale!&rdquo; said Millie. &ldquo;That fellow
from Wycombe could knock his head off in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gossip was doubtful.</p>
<p>Millie was incapable of formulating a plan in this connexion, but
she was seized with a desire for spending the still September evenings
in the open air, and always something drew her towards the hill at
Handy Cross. That way lay interest and excitement. There was a
wonderful fascination in going as far as the top of the descent into
Wycombe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span></p>
<p>Usually she joined one or two other young women in these excursions.
It was understood between them that they went &ldquo;for fun,&rdquo;
and they would laugh and scream when they reached the dip past the
farm, pretend to push each other down the slope, and cry out suddenly:
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming! Run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one afternoon, some ten days after Jasper Thrale had threatened
her with the turnip field, Millie went alone.</p>
<p>She had left work early. The rain had not come yet, and Thrale was
becoming anxious with regard to the shortage of water. He had the
sluices of Marlow and Hedsor weirs closed, and had opened the sluices
of the weirs above as far as Hambledon, but so little water was coming
down that he decided to work shorter hours for the present.</p>
<p>Blanche had stayed on at the mill to help with repairs. She was
rapidly developing into a capable engineer. So Millie, whose only
service was that of machine minder, found herself alone and
unoccupied.</p>
<p>Every one else seemed to be working. Her friends of the evening
excursions were mostly in the fields on the Henley side of the
town.</p>
<p>Millie decided she would lie down on the bed and go to sleep for a
bit; but even before she came to the cottage she changed her mind. It
was a deliciously warm, still afternoon.</p>
<p>Almost automatically she took the road towards Little Marlow; a
desire for adventure had overtaken her. Why, she argued,
shouldn&rsquo;t she go into Wycombe? There were plenty of other women
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>there. She would be quite safe. She only wanted
to see what the place was like.</p>
<p>Her consciousness of perfect rectitude lasted until she reached the
dip beyond Handy Cross. Farther than this she had not ventured before.
Some mystery lay beyond the turn of the road.</p>
<p>She sat down in the grass by the wayside and called herself a fool,
but she was afraid to go further. She and those friends of hers had
made this place the entrance to a terrible and fascinating beyond. She
remembered how they had feared to stay there in the failing light,
daring each other to remain there alone after sunset. There was nothing
to be afraid of, she said to herself; and yet she was afraid.</p>
<p>She was hot with her long climb, and the place was quite deserted.
She decided to take down her hair to cool herself.</p>
<p>Curiously, she looked upon this simple act as deliciously daring and
in some way wicked. She cast half-fearful glances at the green girt
shadows of the descending road, as she shook out the masses of her
hair. &ldquo;If anyone should come!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If
<i>he</i> should come&#8202;&hellip;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She giggled nervously, and shivered.</p>
<p>But as time passed, and no one came, she began to lose her fear, and
presently she lay full length on the grass, and stared up into the pale
blue dome of the sky until her eyes ached and she had to close them.
The deep hush of the still afternoon enveloped her in a great calm.</p>
<p>For a time she slept peacefully, and then she dreamed that she was
rushing through the air, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=
"#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>that some one chased her. She
wanted desperately to be captured, but it was ordained that she must
fly, and she flew incredibly fast. She flew through the sunlight into
darkness, and awoke to find that some one was standing between her and
the sun.</p>
<p>She lay still, paralysed with terror. She bitterly regretted her
coming. She would have given ten years of life to be safe home in
Marlow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where&rsquo;ve I seen you before?&rdquo; asked Sam
Evans&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark when Blanche accosted a knot of women in the High
Street with a question as to whether they had seen anything of her
sister.</p>
<p>One of the women laughed sneeringly. &ldquo;Ah! She went over the
hill this afternoon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We were in the fields that
side, and saw her go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche&rsquo;s face burned. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t! I know she
hasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she blurted out. &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t one of
that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of the lucky ones,&rdquo; another woman
remarked. &ldquo;You can expect her back in a week or two&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the same evening that Millie crossed the hill, Lady
Eileen Ferrar encountered the spirit of passion in another shape.</p>
<p>The thought of a lonely bathe tempted her, and she crossed the
river, made her way through deserted Bisham, and back to the stream
along a narrow, overhung lane beyond Bisham Abbey. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sun had set, but when she came out from the trees there was
light in the sky and on the water. Overhead a few wisps of cirrus,
sailing in the far heights of air, still caught the direct rays of the
sun. Eileen paused on the bank, rejoicing in the glow of colour about
her; but as she gazed, the little fleet of salmon-tinted clouds were
engulfed in the great earth-shadow, and the delicate crisp rose-leaves
were transfigured into flat stipples of steel grey.</p>
<p>A slight chill had come into the air, but the water was deliciously
soft and warm. Eileen swam a couple of hundred yards up-stream, towards
the gloom of shadows that obscured the course of the river. The
after-glow was fading now, and though the surface of the water seemed
to catch some reflection of light from an unknown source, the near
distance loomed dark and mysterious. She trod water for a few moments,
but could not decide whether the river turned to right or left. To all
appearances, it terminated abruptly fifty yards
ahead&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>A new sound was forcing itself upon her attention&mdash;a low,
steady booming. She stopped swimming, and, keeping herself afloat by
slow, silent movements of hands and feet under water, she listened
attentively. The dull boom seemed changed into a low, ceaseless
moan.</p>
<p>She remembered then the recently opened sluices of Temple Weir, but
quite suddenly she was aware of fear. She thought she saw a movement
among the reeds by the bank. She thought she heard laughter and the
thin pipe of a flute.</p>
<p>Were the old gods coming back to witness the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>death of man, as they had witnessed his birth?
Now that machinery and civilization were being re-absorbed into the
nature-spirit from which they had been wrung by the force of
man&rsquo;s devilish and alien intelligence, were the old things
returning for one mad revel before the creatures of their sport
disappeared for ever, these representatives of a species which had
failed to hold its own in the struggle for existence?</p>
<p>Night was coming up like a shadow, and in the east a red, enormous
moon was rising, coming not to dissipate, but to enhance the mysteries
of the dark, coming to countenance the wild and blind the eyes of
man.</p>
<p>Eileen, almost motionless, was floating down with the drift of the
sluggish stream. She was afraid to intrude upon the natural sounds of
the night, the stealthy trickle of the river, and the furtive rustle of
secret movement whose origin she could not guess. And again she thought
that she heard the trembling reed of a distant flute.</p>
<p>She touched bottom near her landing-place, and waded out of the
river, crouching, afraid even in the black shadow of the trees to
exhibit the white column of her slim body. She dried and dressed
hastily, and when she felt again the touch of her familiar clothes
about her, she knew that she was safe from the wiles of nymph or satyr.
She had come out of the half-world that interposes between man and
Nature; her clothes made her invisible to the earth-gods, and hid them
from her knowledge. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263"
name="pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>But she was still trembling and afraid. The flesh had terrors great
as those of the spirit.</p>
<p>A little uncertain wind was coming out of the south-west, and the
trees were stirred now and again into hushed whisperings. A dead leaf
brushed her face in falling, and she started back, thrusting at an
imaginary enemy with nervously agitated hands.</p>
<p>The thought of her remoteness from life terrified her. She was
alone, face to face with implacable, brutal Nature. Man, the boastful,
full of foolish pride, was vanishing from the earth. He had been an
alien, ever out of place, defiling and corrupting the order of growth.
Now he was beaten and a fugitive. All around her, the representative of
this vile destructive species, was the slow, persistent hatred of the
earth, which longed to be at peace again. There was no god favourable
to man, now that he was dying; the gods of man&rsquo;s creation would
perish with him. Only a few women were left to realize that they were
strangers in the world of Nature which hated them. The world was not
theirs, had never been theirs; they were only some horrible, unnatural
fungus that had disfigured the Earth for a time&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She moved cautiously and slowly under the darkness of the trees, and
even when she came back to the road she could not shake off her fear.
On her right she could see the black cliff of the woods<a id=
"xd26e4466" name="xd26e4466"></a> transfigured by the light of the
moon. In the day she knew them for woods; now they were strange and
threatening; they menaced her with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264"
href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>invasion. She knew that they
would march down from the hills and swarm across the valley. In a
hundred, two hundred years, Marlow would be a few heaps of brick and
stone lost in the heart of the forest.</p>
<p>Ashamed of her race, she hurried on stealthily towards the
bridge.</p>
<p>But before she reached it, she heard the sound of a firm, defiant
step coming towards her. She paused and listened, and her fear fell
from her. In the old days she would have feared man more than Nature,
feared robbery or assault, but now, man was united in a common cause;
the sound of humanity was the sound of a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; she called, and the voice of Jasper Thrale
answered. &ldquo;Hullo! Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me&mdash;Eileen,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
for a bathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused opposite her, and they looked at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jolly night,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the great god Pan,&rdquo; said Eileen.
&ldquo;Those sailors in the Ionian Sea were misinformed. He&rsquo;s not
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Pan die and Dionysus live?&rdquo; returned Thrale.
&ldquo;I hear that Dionysus has claimed one of our hands, by the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Not with Millie. If <i>you</i> saw Pan, why
shouldn&rsquo;t <i>she</i> see Dionysus? No, I&rsquo;m angry with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>Jenkyn woman. She&rsquo;s saying that we ought
not to have Millie back if she wants to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How silly!&rdquo; commented Eileen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if that were all!&rdquo; replied Thrale. &ldquo;The real
trouble is that the Jenkyn woman is proselytizing. She wants to revive
Church services and Sunday observances. We&rsquo;re going to have a
split before the winter&rsquo;s over, and all the old misunderstandings
and antagonisms back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course we are,&rdquo; returned Eileen, after a pause.
&ldquo;We are going to divide into those that are afraid and those that
aren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s fear that&rsquo;s got hold of us, now
we&rsquo;ve time to think. It&rsquo;s all about us to-night; I&rsquo;ve
seen it, and Millie has seen it; and Clara Jenkyn and all those who are
going with her have seen it; and we&rsquo;ve all got to find our own
way out.&rdquo; She hesitated for a moment, and then said: &ldquo;And
what about you? Have you seen it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the first time. Within the last ten minutes,&rdquo;
said Thrale.</p>
<p>The moon was above the trees now, and she could see his face
clearly. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
picture it. It can&rsquo;t be Pan or Dionysus, or fear of the Earth or
of humanity. No; and it can&rsquo;t be the most terrible of all, the
fear of an idea. What are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of you,&rdquo; said Thrale, and he turned
away quickly and hurried on in the direction of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>did</i> see Pan,&rdquo; affirmed Eileen, as she
returned, happy and unafraid, towards Marlow. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That mood of the night had suggested to Eileen the
idea of a single cause which seemed sufficient to account for the
revivalist tendencies of Miss Jenkyn and certain other women in Marlow.
Fear was presented as a simple explanation, and Eileen, like many other
philosophers who had preceded her, was too eager for the simple and
inclusive explanation.</p>
<p>At first the revivalist tendency was feeble and circumscribed.
Twenty or thirty women met in the schoolroom and talked and prayed by
the light of a single, tenderly nursed oil-lamp. The absence of any
minister kept them back at first; the less earnest needed some concrete
embodiment of religion in the form of a black coat and white tie.</p>
<p>But when the rain came in early October, came and persisted; when
the beeches, instead of flaring into scarlet, grew sodden and dead;
when the threat of flood grew even more imminent, and the distraction
of physical toil almost ceased, this little nucleus of women was joined
by many new recruits, and their comparatively harmless prostrations,
lamentations and worshippings of the abstract, developed into an
attempt to enforce a moral law upon the community.</p>
<p>Millie Gosling, returning to Marlow in mid-October, gave the
religionists splendid opportunity for a first demonstration.</p>
<p>Millie returned with a bold face and a shrinking heart. She had fled
from Wycombe because she could not meet the taunts of the women who had
so lately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>envied her as she rode, prime favourite for a
time, in the Dionysian landau. A great loneliness had come over her
after she was dethroned; she needed sympathy, and she hoped that
Blanche might be made to understand. Millie came back from over the
hill prepared with a long tale of excuses.</p>
<p>She found her sister perfectly complacent.</p>
<p>Blanche was a fervent disciple of Jasper Thrale and machinery, and
Thrale had anticipated Millie&rsquo;s return and in some ways prepared
for it. At odd moments he had preached the new gospel, the tenets of
which Blanche had begun to formulate for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good going back to the old morality for a
precedent,&rdquo; had been the essential argument used by Thrale;
&ldquo;we have to face new conditions. If a man is only to have one
wife now, the race will decline, probably perish. It is a woman&rsquo;s
duty to bear children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eileen, Blanche and a few other young women had wondered that he
made no application of the argument to his own case, but his opinion
carried more weight by reason of his continence. Even Miss Jenkyn could
not urge that his opinion was framed to defend his own mode of life,
and, failing that casuistical support, she had to fall back on the
second alternative of her kind, namely, to assert that this preacher of
antagonistic opinions was either the devil in person or possessed by
him&mdash;a line of defence which took longer to establish than the
simple accusation of expediency.</p>
<p>So Millie, returning one wet October afternoon, found that no
excuses were required of her. Blanche <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>welcomed her and
asked no questions, and Jasper Thrale and Eileen came to the little
cottage in St Peter&rsquo;s Street at sunset and treated the prodigal
Millie with a new and altogether delightful friendliness. It was
understood that she would return at once to her work in the Mill. But
in the school-house opposite another reception was being prepared for
her.</p>
<p>The more advanced of the Jenkynites were for taking immediate
action. Prayer, worship, and the acknowledgment of personal sin fell
into the background that evening, Millie appeared not as a brand to be
saved from the burning, but as an abandoned and evil creature who must
be thrust out of the community if any member of it was to save her soul
alive. Every one of these furious religionists could stand up and
declare that she was innocent of the commission of this particular sin
of Millie&rsquo;s, and every one was willing and anxious to cast the
first stone.</p>
<p>The meeting simmered, and at last boiled over into St Peter&rsquo;s
Street. A band of more than a dozen rigidly virtuous and ecstatically
Christian women beat at the door of the Goslings&rsquo; cottage. They
had come to denounce sin and thrust the sinner out of the community
with physical violence. Each of them in her own heart thought of
herself as the bride of Christ.</p>
<p>The door was opened to them by Jasper Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have come to cast out the evil one!&rdquo; cried Miss
Jenkyn in a high emotional voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; asked Thrale. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall be cast forth from our midst!&rdquo; shrilled Miss
Jenkyn; and her supporters raised a horrible screaming cry of
agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast her forth!&rdquo; they cried, finding full justification
for their high pitch of emotion in the use of Biblical phrase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast forth your grandmother!&rdquo; replied Thrale calmly.
&ldquo;Get back to your homes, and don&rsquo;t be foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is possessed of the devil!&rdquo; chanted Miss Jenkyn.
&ldquo;The Lord has called upon us to vindicate his honour and glory.
This man, too, must not be suffered to dwell in the
congregation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with him! down with him!&rdquo; assented the little
crowd, now so exalted with the glory of their common purpose that they
were ready for martyrdom.</p>
<p>Miss Jenkyn was an undersized, withered little spinster of
forty-five, and physically impotent; but, drunk with the fervour of her
emotion, and encouraged by the sympathy of her followers and the fury
of her own voice, she flung herself fiercely upon the calm figure of
Jasper Thrale. Her thwarted self-expression had found an outlet. She
desired the blood of Millie Gosling and Jasper Thrale with the same
intensity that women had once desired a useless vote.</p>
<p>Jasper Thrale put out a careless hand and pushed her back into the
arms of the women behind her; but she was up again instantly, and,
backed by the crowd, who, encouraging themselves by shrill screams of
&ldquo;Cast them forth!&rdquo; were now thrusting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>forward into the narrow doorway, she renewed the
assault with all the fierce energy of a struggling kitten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall lose my temper in a minute,&rdquo; said Thrale, as he
took a step forward and, bracing himself against the door frame, drove
the women back with vigorous thrusts of his powerful arms.</p>
<p>To lose his temper, indeed, seemed the only way of escape; to give
way to berserk rage, and so to injure these muscularly feeble creatures
that they would be unable to continue the struggle. But the babble of
screaming voices was bringing other helpers to his aid, chief among
them Lady Durham, and her cold, clear voice fell on the hysterical
Jenkynites like a douche of cold water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara Jenkyn, what are you doing?&rdquo; asked Elsie
Durham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millie Gosling must be cast forth,&rdquo; wavered the little
dishevelled woman; but this time there was no reponse from her
disciples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a question for the committee,&rdquo; replied Elsie
Durham. &ldquo;Now, please go to your homes, all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Jenkyn tried to explain.</p>
<p>Elsie Durham walked into the cottage and shut the door.</p>
<p>Inside, Eileen and Blanche were trying to reassure the trembling
Millie. Outside, the Jenkynites were suffering a more brutal martyrdom
than that they had sought. The tongues of the new arrivals, the
fuller-blooded, more physically vigorous members of the community, were
making sport of these brides of Christ. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But the women of Marlow were to learn afresh the old
lesson that religious enthusiasm is not to be killed by ridicule or
oppression. Jasper Thrale understood and appreciated that fact, but the
policy he suggested could not be approved by the committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This emotion is a fundamental thing,&rdquo; he said to Lady
Durham, &ldquo;and history will show you that persecution will
intensify it to the point of martyrdom. There is only one way to combat
it. Give it room. Let them do as they will. The heat of the fire is too
fierce for you to damp it down; you only supply more fuel. Fan it,
throw it open to the air, and it will burn itself harmlessly
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie Durham shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very
well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s perfectly true. But
they make you the bone of contention. If it were only Millie
Gosling&mdash;well&mdash;she might go. We could find a place for
her&mdash;at Fingest, perhaps. But we can&rsquo;t spare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why not,&rdquo; returned Thrale. &ldquo;I
never intended to stay indefinitely. You can carry on now without me,
and I can fulfil my original intention and push on into the
West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man! we can&rsquo;t, and we won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said
Elsie Durham. &ldquo;You are indispensable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is indispensable,&rdquo; replied Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother your metaphysics, Jasper!&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;We are not going to let you go. &lsquo;We&rsquo; is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>the
majority of Marlow, not only the committee. We&rsquo;ll fight the
fanatics somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The majority referred to by Elsie Durham was fairly compact in
relation to this issue of retaining Jasper Thrale, and included the two
greater of the three recognizable parties in the community. Of these
three, the greatest was the moderate party, made up of Episcopalians,
Nonconformists and a few Roman Catholics, who found relief for their
emotion one day in seven either in the Town Hall or Marlow Church, in
which places services and meetings were held&mdash;the former by
certain approved individuals, notably Elsie Durham and the widow of the
late Rector of Marlow. The second party in order of size included all
those who either denied the Divine revelation or were careless of all
religious matters. The third party&mdash;the Jenkynites, as they were
dubbed by their opponents&mdash;had drawn their numbers from every old
denomination. The Jenkynites were differentiated from the other two
parties by certain physical differences. For instance, the Jenkynites
numbered few members under the age of thirty-five; very few of them
were fat, and very few of them were capable field workers; they were
hungry-eyed, and had a certain air of disappointed eagerness about
them; they looked as though they had for ever sought something, and,
finding it, had remained unsatisfied. In all, there were some seventeen
women who might have been regarded as quite true to type, and about
this vivid nucleus were clustered nearly a hundred other women, many of
whom exhibited some characteristic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273"
href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>mark of the same type, while
the remainder, perhaps 40 per cent of the whole body, had joined the
party out of bravado, to seek excitement, or for some purpose of
expediency.</p>
<p>Among the last was Mrs Isaacson, who was the ultimate cause of the
Jenkynite defeat.</p>
<p>Ever since she had passed her examination in farm supervision, Mrs
Isaacson had exhibited an increasing tendency to rest on her laurels.
She had grown very stout again during her stay in Marlow, and
complained of severe heart trouble. The least exertion brought on
violent palpitation accompanied by the most alarming symptoms. The poor
lady would gasp for breath, press her hands convulsively to a spot just
below her left breast, and roll up her eyes till they presented only a
terrifying repulsive rim of blood-streaked white, if the least exertion
were demanded from her, and yet she would persist in the effort until
absolutely on the verge of collapse. &ldquo;No, no! I must work!&rdquo;
she would insist. &ldquo;It iss not fair to the others that I do no
work. I will try once more. It iss only fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At times they had to insist that she should return home and
rest.</p>
<p>And as the winter closed in, Mrs Isaacson&rsquo;s rests became more
and more protracted. Jasper Thrale grinned and said: &ldquo;I suppose
we&rsquo;ve got to keep her&rdquo;; but there was a feeling among the
other members of the committee that they were creating an undesirable
precedent. Mrs Isaacson&rsquo;s example was being followed by other
women who preferred rest to work. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274"
href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p>Heart weakness was becoming endemic in Marlow.</p>
<p>Then came the news that Mrs Isaacson had joined the Jenkynites. The
seventeen received her somewhat doubtfully at first, but the body of
the sect were in favour of her reception. Possibly they were rather
proud of counting one more fat woman among them; the average member was
so noticeably thin.</p>
<p>Even the seventeen were satisfied within a fortnight of Mrs
Isaacson&rsquo;s conversion. She had a wonderful fluency, and she said
the right and proper things in her own peculiar English&mdash;a form of
speech which had a certain piquancy and interest and afforded relief
and variety after the somewhat stereotyped formulas of the
seventeen.</p>
<p>But early in December, before the floods came, Mrs Isaacson was
convicted of a serious offence against the community. One of the
committee&rsquo;s first works had been to store certain priceless
valuables. Tea, coffee, sugar, soap, candles, salt, baking powder, wine
and other irreplaceable commodities had been locked up in one of the
bank premises. In all, they had a fairly large store, upon which they
had hardly drawn as yet. It was not intended to hoard these luxuries
indefinitely. After harvest a dole had been made to all the workers as
acknowledgment of their services, and it had been decided to hold
another festival on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Mrs Isaacson, with unsuspected energy, had burglariously entered
this storehouse of wealth. She had found an accessible window at the
rear, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>which she had succeeded in forcing, and, despite
her bulk and the delicate state of her heart, she had effected an
entrance and stolen tea, sugar, candles and whisky.</p>
<p>She was, indeed, finally caught in the act; but her thefts would
probably have escaped notice&mdash;she worked after dark, and with a
cunning and caution that would have placed her high in the profession
before the plague&mdash;had it not been for Blanche.</p>

<p class="first">It seems that Mrs Isaacson had formed the habit of
staying up in the evening. She pleaded that she could not sleep during
the early hours of the night, which was not surprising in view of the
fact that she slept much during the day; and as she was diligent in
picking up or begging sufficient wood to maintain the fire, there was
no reason why Blanche and Millie should offer any objection. Thrale had
rigged up a dynamo at the mill now to provide artificial light, and the
girls&rsquo; hours of work were so prolonged that they were glad to get
to bed at half-past seven. By eight o&rsquo;clock Mrs Isaacson
evidently counted herself safe from all interruption.</p>
<p>She might have continued her enjoyment of luxury undiscovered
throughout the winter if Blanche had not suffered from toothache.</p>
<p>She had been in bed and asleep nearly two hours when her dreams of
discomfort merged into a consciousness of actual pain. She sighed and
pressed her cheek into the pillows, made agonizing exploration
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>with her tongue, and tried to go to sleep again.
Possibly she might have succeeded had not that unaccountable smell of
whisky obtruded itself upon her senses.</p>
<p>At first she thought the house was on fire. That had always been her
one fear in leaving Mrs Isaacson alone; and she sat up in bed and
sniffed vigorously. &ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;it smells
like&mdash;like plum pudding.&rdquo; The analogy was probably suggested
to her by the odour of burning brandy.</p>
<p>She got up and opened the door of the bedroom.</p>
<p>Mrs Isaacson slept on a sort of glorified landing, and when Blanche
stepped outside her own door she could see at once by the light of a
watery full moon that her lodger had not yet come to bed.</p>
<p>The smell of the spirit was stronger on the landing, and Blanche,
forgetting her toothache in the excitement of the moment, stole quietly
down the short flight of crooked stairs. The door giving on to the
living-room was latched, but there were two convenient knot-holes, and
through one of them she saw Mrs Isaacson seated by the fire drinking
hot tea. On the table stood an open whisky bottle and two lighted wax
candles.</p>
<p>Blanche was thunderstruck. Tea, whisky and candles were inexplicable
things. The thought of witchcraft obtruded itself, and so fascinated
her that she stood on the stairs gazing through the knothole until a
sudden rigour reminded her that she was deadly cold.</p>
<p>She did not interrupt the orgy. She crept back to bed, and after
much difficulty awakened Millie. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277"
href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sound of their voices must have alarmed Mrs Isaacson, for the
girls presently heard her stumbling upstairs. They stopped their
discussion then, and Blanche&rsquo;s toothache being mysteriously cured
by her excitement, they were soon asleep again.</p>
<p>Neither of the girls spoke of their discovery to anyone the next
day, but Blanche returned to the cottage at half-past four, when Mrs
Isaacson was at a meeting over the way, and explored her
bedroom<span class="corr" id="xd26e4671" title="Not in source">.</span>
She found a small store of tea, sugar and candles under the
mattress&mdash;the whisky bottle had disappeared&mdash;and so came to
an understanding of Mrs Isaacson&rsquo;s self-sacrificing insistence
that she should perform all work connected with her own
sleeping-place&mdash;it could hardly be called a room.</p>
<p>After consultation with Millie, Blanche decided that she must inform
Jasper Thrale of the contraband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been stealing, of course,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I suppose we shall have to bring it home to her.&rdquo; But he
laughed at Blanche&rsquo;s indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s stealing from <i>us</i>!&rdquo; said Blanche, who
had developed a fine sense of her duty towards and interest in the
community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! you&rsquo;re quite right,&rdquo; said Thrale.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll inform the committee&mdash;at least, the
non-Jenkynites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The five non-Jenkynites were furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make an example,&rdquo; Elsie Durham said. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t that we shall miss what the Isaacson woman has
taken&mdash;or will take. It&rsquo;s the question of precedent. This is
where we are facing the beginning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278"
href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>of law&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?
Somebody has to protect the members of the community against
themselves. If one steals and goes unpunished, another will
steal<span class="corr" id="xd26e4691" title="Not in source">.</span>
We shall have the women divided into stealers and workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with her?&rdquo; asked Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn her out,&rdquo; replied Elsie Durham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jenkynites won&rsquo;t let her go,&rdquo; said Thrale
raising the larger question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said Elsie Durham, &ldquo;But that
reminds me that we must catch the woman <i lang="la">flagrante
delicto</i>; we must have no quibbles about the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrale agreed with the wisdom of this policy, but refused to take
any part in either the detection or the prosecution of Mrs Isaacson.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll say its a put-up job if I have anything to do with
it,&rdquo; he argued.</p>

<p class="first">The Jenkynites blazed when Rebecca Isaacson was
finally caught and denounced. The culprit, when caught in the act of
entering the bank premises had made a slight error of judgment, and
pleaded the excuse that she was a sleepwalker and quite unconscious of
what she was doing; but she afterwards adopted a sounder line of
defence. She made full confession to the seventeen, pleaded extravagant
penitence with all the necessary references to the blood of the Lamb,
and displayed all the well-known <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>signs that she would become
fervent in well-doing after the ensanguined ablutions had been
metaphorically performed.</p>
<p>The Jenkynites were enraptured with so real a case of sin. They had
been compelled to content themselves with so many minor failures from
grace that the performances were becoming slightly monotonous.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Sister Rebecca&rdquo; case was refreshingly real and
genuine, and they meant to make the most of it. Also, this case gave
them occasion to assert themselves once more against the opinions of
the community.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that the seventeen deliberately adopted a
practical and apparently promising policy. They were not consciously
seeking to obtain civil power as were the priests of the old days
before the plague. The seventeen had no sense of the State as
represented by the community; they were without question perfectly
sincere in their beliefs and actions. Their fault, if it can be so
described, was their inability to adapt themselves to their conditions.
They were as unchangeable as the old lady who had died sooner than be
permanently separated from the glories of a house in Wisteria Grove.
She and the seventeen and many other women in Marlow were demonstrating
that rigidity of opinion is detrimental to the interests of the growing
State. The same proposition had been clearly demonstrated by a few
exceptional individuals in the old days, but progress was so slow, the
property owners so content, and the average of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>mankind so intensely conservative, that their
arguments received no attention. For every man who believed in the
broad principle of maintaining an open mind, there were ten thousand
who were quite incapable of putting the principle into practice. With
these women in Marlow the conditions were completely changed. Moreover,
women are by nature more broad-minded than men in practical affairs.
Where intuition rather than the hard-and-fast methods of an
intellectual logic is being brought into play, new and wonderful
possibilities of adaptation may enter the domain of politics.</p>
<p>The Jenkynites and such individuals as the late Mrs Gosling became
suddenly conspicuous in the new conditions. The type that they
represent cannot persist. They are the bonds on a vigorous and
increasing growth; the tree will grow and burst away all inflexible
restraints.</p>
<p>In Marlow the new and vigorous growth was the sense of the
community. The majority of the women were realizing, consciously or
unconsciously, that they must work with and for each other. The
Jenkynite affair served the committee as a valuable object-lesson.</p>
<p>Mrs Isaacson was free to do as she would while the discussion raged.
Imprisonment would have been utterly futile. The committee did not wish
to punish her for her offence against common property, they merely
wished to rid themselves of an undesirable member and to make public
announcement that they would in like manner exclude any other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>member who proved herself a burden to the
community.</p>
<p>The Jenkynites were characteristically unable to comprehend this
argument. They had their own definitions of heinous and venial sins,
definitions based on ancient precedent, and they counted the fault of
Millie Gosling in the former and that of Rebecca Isaacson in the latter
category. They were not susceptible to argument. As they saw the
problem, no argument was admissible. They had the old law and the old
prophets on their side, and maintained that what was true once was true
for all time. In their opinion, changed conditions did not affect
morality.</p>
<p>If the need for labour had been great, the affair might have been
shelved for a time as of less importance than the dominant economic
demand which takes precedence of all other problems. But although the
floods had not yet come, there was not enough work for all the members
of the community, and this comparative idleness reacted upon the
importance of the Isaacson case in another and probably more
influential direction than the abstract consideration of justice and
humanity.</p>
<p>The women had time to talk, and a new and fascinating subject was
given them to discuss. And they talked; and their talk ripened into
action. The affair Isaacson, which included also the affair Jenkyns,
was brought to a climax at a mass meeting in the Town Hall.</p>
<p>It was decided, noisily, but with considerable emphasis, that for
the good of the community the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282"
href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>Jenkynites must go. The
seventeen were specifically indicated, but it was understood that
certain of their more advanced adherents would go with them.</p>
<p>The Jenkynites accepted the decision in the spirit of their belief.
They were martyrs in a great cause. They would leave this accursed city
(their terminology was always Biblical) and cast off its dust from
their feet&mdash;although the roads were deep in mud at the time. They
would go forth to regenerate the world, upheld by their love of truth
and their zeal for the Word.</p>
<p>Only Mrs Isaacson dissented, but she was compelled to go with
them.</p>
<p>They went forth in the rain, thirty-nine of them in all, exalted
with conscious righteousness and faint with enthusiasm. The women of
Marlow were kind to them. They turned out and jeered the little
procession as it marched out of the town by the Henley Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo stole the tea?&rdquo; was the most popular taunt,
and no doubt the exiles would have preferred that the taunts should
have been cast at their faith rather than at the social misdemeanour of
an obscure convert. But any form of martyrdom was better than none, and
they held their heads high and sang &ldquo;Glory! glory!&rdquo; with
magnificent fervour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve done right,&rdquo; commented Elsie
Durham. &ldquo;But we should never have had all the women with us if
there had been no offence against property. That touched
them&mdash;communal property. I&rsquo;m not sure that it isn&rsquo;t
become almost dearer than personal property.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="first">From the middle of November onwards, the river had
been running nearly bank-high, and so much power was available that
Thrale had been considering the possibility of lighting some of the
nearer houses by electricity. He had made three journeys to London, and
with half a dozen assistants he had rifled two dynamos from the power
station just outside Paddington, and had brought back twenty
truck-loads of coal.</p>
<p>The dynamos, however, were still in the truck, covered by tarpaulin.
Thrale had decided that the luxury of artificial lighting could not be
provided until all the grain had been thrashed and milled. The end of
that work was now in sight, and the accumulated wealth of flour in
Marlow was calculated to be sufficient to last the community for at
least twelve months. But before the lighting scheme could be put in
hand, a new trouble had threatened.</p>
<p>During the first week of December there was almost continuous rain,
and the river began to top its banks, spreading itself over the
meadowland below the lock and creeping up the end of St Peter&rsquo;s
Street. No serious matter as yet, and a short spell of frost and clear
skies followed; but before Christmas heavy rains came again, and Thrale
began to grow anxious. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The weirs down-stream ought to be opened,&rdquo; he explained
to Eileen. &ldquo;They are probably all up; we need never be afraid of
shortage here; if we close our own weir we can always hold up all the
water we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it serious?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but it may be,&rdquo; he said, looking up at the
sky. &ldquo;All Marlow might be flooded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And still the rain fell, and soon the girls had to wade through a
foot of water to reach the mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go down-stream and open all the weirs,&rdquo; Thrale
announced on Christmas Eve. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking at a steam
launch over at the boat-house; it&rsquo;s in quite good condition. I
shall bring it up to the town landing-stage to-morrow and get enough
coal and food aboard to last a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going alone?&rdquo; said Eileen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I <i>must</i> take some one to work the engine and the
locks,&rdquo; returned Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; announced Eileen, with glee.</p>
<p>Thrale shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to run this
place,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Since that night in September no reference had been made by either
of them to his strange revelation of fear. They had worked together as
two men might have worked. Neither of them had exhibited the least
consciousness of sex. Thrale believed that he had put the fear away
from him, and Eileen was content to wait. She was barely twenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blanche could run the mill,&rdquo; she suggested.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to do now.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thrale turned away from her with a touch of impatience.
&ldquo;Blanche had better come with me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>want</i> to come,&rdquo; pleaded Eileen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to trust Blanche with the mill,&rdquo; he
persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s every bit as good as I am,&rdquo; was her
reply.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look here,&rdquo; said Eileen, &ldquo;you might let me
come, or are you&mdash;are you afraid of&mdash;of what the women will
say?&rdquo; She was standing by one of the flour-encrusted mill windows
and she began to scratch a clean place on it with her nail.</p>
<p>Thrale did not answer for a moment and then he came and stood near
her. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are you sick of your
work here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind a change,&rdquo; she said, intent on
enlarging her peep-hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One forgets that you are women,&rdquo; said Thrale. &ldquo;I
suppose women are never content with work for work&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; returned Eileen inconsequently. &ldquo;I
can see out now. Why don&rsquo;t we have these windows cleaned
sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have them done while I&rsquo;m away,&rdquo; he
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming with you,&rdquo; said Eileen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you can come if you like,&rdquo; he said. He thought he
was perfectly safe, despite this unusual display of femininity.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to run the engine,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll run the engine,&rdquo; she agreed and looked
down at her capable, frankly dirty little hands.</p>

<p class="first">The weirs at Marlow and Hedsor had been roaring
open-mouthed for ten days before Thrale and Eileen began their journey;
but the water had been piling up from below and the floods were working
back up river. The fact that none of the weirs above Henley was closed
had served to protect Marlow in some degree. There were great floods
above Sonning, and from Goring to Culham the country was a vast sheet
of water. This water, however, only came down comparatively slowly
owing to the dammed condition of the main channel, and a greater
proportion of it was absorbed. If the upper weirs had been open, Marlow
would have been under water by the middle of December.</p>
<p>Not until the launch had been man&oelig;uvred with some difficulty
through Boulter&rsquo;s Lock did Thrale begin to realize the full
significance of the situation.</p>
<p>He had had very great difficulty first in reaching and second in
raising the paddles of the Taplow weir. In one place the force of the
flood had broken away the structure, but even with the relief this
passage had afforded the pressure of water on the paddles was so great
that he had been working for more than two hours before the last valve
was opened. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eileen had been waiting for him with the launch warped up just below
the lock where the force of the stream was not so great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether we shall be able to carry out this
job,&rdquo; remarked Thrale when he rejoined her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we must,&rdquo; she expostulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see what has happened?&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;All
the water is piled up below us. We shall probably find the next locks
flood-high, which means that we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be able to open
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must navigate,&rdquo; said Eileen. &ldquo;Steam round
them; shoot the weirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Thrale, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering how
far our responsibility goes. If we don&rsquo;t open the river right
down to Richmond, we shall only be increasing the flood in the lower
reaches, and there may be women living there. After all, Marlow
isn&rsquo;t the only place on the river. And there is another thing; we
may never get back. It&rsquo;s a risky thing we are proposing to do. No
one could swim against this current. If we were upset and carried into
a weir, we should be smashed to pieces in no time. Do you think the
community can spare us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother the community!&rdquo; replied Eileen.</p>
<p>The community and its activities were already in the background of
her mind. Marlow had receded into a little distant place with which she
was no longer connected. The world of adventure and romance lay open
before her. She wanted only to explore this turbulent river, widened
now into a miniature Amazon, from which arose the islands of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>half-submerged houses and trees that composed
the strange archipelago of Maidenhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Thrale again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try.
It&rsquo;s no use waiting for the stream to go down. We&rsquo;d better
go on now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I cast off?&rdquo; asked Eileen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, steady,&rdquo; Thrale warned her. &ldquo;The next
quarter of a mile is simply a rapid. You must be ready to get the
engines going full ahead the moment we start, or I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
be able to steer her. And, now, we must both cast off together or we
shall be across the stream in two ticks. Just loosen the rope round the
cleats and let go, and then start the engine. Let the loose end of the
rope drag till we&rsquo;ve time to pick it up. Are you ready? All
right&mdash;cast off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little launch swept out into the current with a bound the
instant she was released from her moorings, and almost before the
engines began to revolve she was caught in the rapids that surged down
from the newly-opened weir. She was only a light draught pleasure-boat,
designed to navigate the placid surface of the summer Thames, and when
she entered the curling broken water below the island she threw up her
nose and plunged like a nervous mare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full steam ahead,&rdquo; shouted Thrale at the toy wheel.
Eileen nodded, crouching over her little engine; the roar of the stream
had drowned Thrale&rsquo;s voice, but she guessed his order.</p>
<p>Her eyes were bright with excitement. She had no sense of fear. She
was exhilarated by the sense <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=
"#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>of rapid movement. The launch,
indeed, was travelling at a remarkable pace. In the narrow channel
between the islands and the town, the river must have been running at
nearly ten miles an hour, and the engines were probably adding another
eight. In the wide spaces of the ocean eighteen miles an hour may
appear a safe and controllable speed, but this little launch was
running down hill, she could not be stopped at command, and the
restricted course was beset with many and dangerous obstacles.</p>
<p>Thrale, handling the little brass wheel forward, was conscious of
uneasiness. The launch steered after a fashion, but he had little
control of her. The trees on the banks appeared to be flying upstream
at the pace of an express train, and ahead of him was the town
bridge.</p>
<p>He decided instantly that they could not pass under it, and put the
wheel over, intending to shoot out of the stream into the calm of the
flood water over the new open bank. But as the launch turned and came
across, the current took her stern and turned her half round. For a
moment her lee rail was under water, and she trembled and rocked on the
verge of capsize. Then her engines drove her out of the stream and she
righted herself again and began to cut through the almost still,
shallow flood water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop her!&rdquo; roared Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; replied Eileen, coolly, as she
obeyed the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No room to pass under the bridge,&rdquo; said Thrale.
&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to navigate, as you call it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>Go dead slow, and be prepared to stop her at a
moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent over an hour in finding a passage round the approach to
the bridge. They had laboriously to pole the launch through the tops of
hedges, and in one place they were aground for ten minutes. But after
they had returned to the stream once more they had a rapid and easy
passage down to Bray. They shot the great arch of the Maidenhead
railway bridge triumphantly. Eileen said it was
&ldquo;glorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weir at Bray proved even more difficult to negotiate than the
one above, and by the time it was fully opened the dull December
afternoon was closing in.</p>
<p>They spent that night moored to two of the elms that ring the
isolated little church in the meadows by Boveney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this rate,&rdquo; remarked Thrale as they settled
themselves for the night, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll take us a week to get to
Richmond. We&rsquo;ve done two weirs out of thirteen, so
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Thrale&rsquo;s estimate proved excessive. They reached
Richmond on the fourth day out from Marlow, having opened another nine
weirs&mdash;the one at Old Windsor had been swept away, and the one
below Richmond Bridge Thrale opened that afternoon.</p>
<p>During those four days they had seen few signs of life. They had
moved, keeping to the main stream <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>for the most part, in the
midst of a wide expanse of water; exploring a desolate and wasted
country.</p>
<p>Once they had been hailed by three women, who looked out at them
from a house in Windsor, and shouted something they did not catch; and
a woman had been standing on Staines Bridge as they careered intrepidly
through the centre arch&mdash;they had no time even to distinguish her
dress. But with these exceptions they might have come through the land
of an extinct civilization, devoid of life; a land in which deserted
houses and church towers stood up from the silver sheet of a vast lake,
that was threaded by this one impetuous torrent of swelling river.</p>
<p>Richmond, also, was deserted. The emigrants had passed on over the
river or southwards to Petersham and so into Surrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Eileen, wiping her oil-blackened hands on a
bunch of cotton waste, &ldquo;that job&rsquo;s done. We&rsquo;ve fairly
drawn the plug of the cistern now. And how are we going to get
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a couple of bicycles somewhere here,&rdquo;
said Thrale.</p>
<p>It had been a clear day, and there was a suggestion of frost in the
air. The sun was setting very red and full behind the bare trees across
the river. Save for the gurgle and hiss of the eddying flood,
everything was very still. The little launch which had served them so
well, and bore the marks of its great adventure in broken rails and
bruised sides, was run aground by the side of the bridge. Thrale was
standing in the road, but Eileen still sat by her engine. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to leave the launch,&rdquo; she said, after a long
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can come back and fetch her up when the flood goes
down,&rdquo; returned Thrale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done pretty well, the three of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the three of us,<span class="corr" id="xd26e4927" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> he echoed.<a id="xd26e4930" name=
"xd26e4930"></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been great fun,&rdquo; sighed Eileen.</p>
<p>Thrale did not reply. He was thinking himself back into the past. He
saw a street in Melbourne on a burning December evening, and the figure
of a gaily-clad little brunette who spoke purest cockney and asked him
why he looked so glum. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to a
funeral,&rdquo; she had said. Yet afterwards he had believed that
something had been buried that night. He had faced his own passion and
the sight of it had disgusted him. He had seen the shadow of a demon
who might master him, and he had grappled with it; he believed that he
had slain and buried lust in Melbourne ten years ago. It had not risen
up to confront him when the plague had put a world of women at his
command. He had not been forced to fight, he was not
tempted&mdash;surely the thing was dead and buried. Only once, on that
warm September night, had he felt a sudden furious desire to take this
girl into his arms and fly with her into the woods. The desire had come
and gone, he was master of it, and in any case it bore no resemblance
to the brutal thing he had faced in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Nor, as he stood now by Richmond Bridge watching the vault of the
sky deepen to an intenser blue, did the feeling that possessed him in
any way resemble that old cruel passion which had flared up and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>died&mdash;surely it had died. He could not
analyse his feeling for this brave, clear-eyed companion, who had faced
with him all the dangers of the past four days without a sign of fear.
She had made no advances to him, they were friends, she might have been
some delightfully clean, wholesome boy. And then his thought was
pierced and broken by a horrible suggestion.</p>
<p>A picture of the hill to Handy Cross flashed before him, and he saw
a little lonely figure creeping furtively away from Marlow. He drove
his nails into his palms and suddenly cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said Eileen, turning round and
looking up at him. &ldquo;Have you forgotten anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped into the boat and sat down beside her. &ldquo;I want to
know&mdash;I must know,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She looked at him and smiled. &ldquo;All right, old man,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you once that I was frightened of you,&rdquo; said
Thrale. &ldquo;I want to know if you have ever been frightened of
yourself&mdash;or of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could never be frightened of you,&rdquo; she replied, and
looked away towards the rising darkness of the shadows across the
hurrying river, &ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t been afraid of
myself&mdash;yet. I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you be frightened of me if I picked you up and
ran shouting into the woods?&rdquo; he asked, fiercely.</p>
<p>Her eyes met his without reserve. &ldquo;Dear old man,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I should love it. I&rsquo;m so glad you understand. That
was the one thing that prevented our being real friends. I&rsquo;ve
wanted so much to be frank <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>and open with you. It&rsquo;s all
these silly reserves that make love abominable. Now we can be two
jolly, clean human beings who understand each other, can&rsquo;t we?
And we shall be such ripping good friends always; quite open and honest
with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew a deep, sighing breath and put his arms round her, drew her
close to him and laid his face against hers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
such an awful ass,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought
that love was unclean. I&rsquo;ve been like that Jenkyn woman.
I&rsquo;ve been prurient and suspicious and evil-minded. I&rsquo;ve
been like the people who cover up statues. But there was an excuse for
me&mdash;and for them, too. I didn&rsquo;t know, because there was no
woman like you to teach me. All the women I&rsquo;ve known have been
secretive and sly. They&rsquo;ve fouled love for me by making it seem a
hidden, disreputable thing. Oh! we shall be ripping good friends,
little Eileen&mdash;magnificent friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a jolly old boat, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; replied
Eileen, inconsequently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smother me, old man. And, I
say, do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to raid some soap from somewhere?
Do look at my hands! You couldn&rsquo;t be friends with a chap who had
hands like that!&rdquo; &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;d like to remark,&rdquo; said
Eileen the next morning. There had been a frost in the night, and there
was every promise of an easy ride back to Marlow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Thrale, examining the deflated tyres of two
bicycles they had chosen from a shop in the High Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d never have understood each other so well
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>if we hadn&rsquo;t worked together on the same
job,&rdquo; said Eileen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course not,&rdquo; returned Thrale. His tone seemed
to imply that she had stated a truth that must always have been obvious
to sensible people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That and there being no footle about marriage,&rdquo;
concluded Eileen.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A third factor that had contributed to the perfection
of that complete understanding was not realized by either until they
were descending the hill into Bisham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather wish we weren&rsquo;t going back,&rdquo; said
Eileen. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop a moment. I want to talk. We&rsquo;ve
never thought of what we&rsquo;re going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; said Jasper, as he dismounted. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ve just got to make an announcement and that&rsquo;s the end
of it. The Jenkyns lot have all gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the end, it&rsquo;s the beginning,&rdquo;
replied Eileen. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that we can&rsquo;t even
explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall. We shall have to&mdash;in a way. It&rsquo;ll take
years and years to do it. But the point is that they won&rsquo;t
understand, now, none of them, not even Elsie Durham. We aren&rsquo;t
free any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t alone,&rdquo; she added, bringing the
hitherto unacknowledged factor into prominence.</p>
<p>Thrale frowned and looked up into the thin brightness of the frosty
sky. &ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s public opinion that compels one to regard love as
shameful and secret. Alone together, free from every suspicion, we
hadn&rsquo;t a doubt. But now, we have to explain and we can&rsquo;t
explain, and we are forced against our wills to wonder whether we can
be right and all the rest of the world wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>are</i> right,&rdquo; put in Eileen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only we can&rsquo;t prove it to anyone but
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shouldn&rsquo;t want to, if we hadn&rsquo;t got to
live with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment they looked at one another thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we mustn&rsquo;t run away,&rdquo; Jasper said, with
determination, after a pause. &ldquo;Look, the flood has begun to go
down already. That&rsquo;s our work. There&rsquo;s other work for us to
do yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they were silent, looking down on to Marlow and out over
the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t go over <i>that</i> hill,&rdquo; said Eileen,
at last, pointing to the distant rise of Handy Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jasper, and then, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t
hide behind hills. Damn public opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, damn public opinion,&rdquo; agreed Eileen.
&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t stay in Marlow always.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="first">The frost gave way on the third night, and for ten
days there was a spell of mild weather with some rain. Carrie Oliver
began to contemplate the possibility of getting forward with such
ploughing as still remained to be done. She proposed to have an
increased acreage of arable that year, and less pasture, less hay and
less turnips; the arable was to include potatoes, beans and peas. For
the community was rapidly tending towards vegetarianism. They had no
butcher in Marlow, and the women revolted against the slaughter of
cattle and sheep. They were hesitating and clumsy in the attack, and so
inflicted wounds which were not fatal, they turned sick at the sight of
the brute&rsquo;s agonies and at the appalling spurts of blood, and
finally when the animal was at last mercifully dead, they bungled the
dissection of the carcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner starve than do it again,&rdquo; was the
invariable decision pronounced by any new volunteer who had heroically
offered to provide Marlow with meat, and even Carrie Oliver admitted
that it was a &ldquo;beastly dirty job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; she added &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to go on
breeding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>calves or we won&rsquo;t get no milk, an&rsquo;
what are we goin&rsquo; to do with the bullocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The committee wondered if some form of barter might not be
introduced. Wycombe and Henley might have something to offer in
exchange, or, failing that, might be urged to accept these superfluous
beasts as a present, returning the skins and horns, for which there
might be a use in the near future. Sheep must be reared for their
wool&mdash;the clothes of the community would not last for ever. The
subjects of tanning and weaving were being studied by certain members
of the now enlarged committee. Neither operation presented insuperable
difficulties.</p>
<p>Now that a certain supply of food was provided for, the community
was already turning its energy towards the industries. Many schemes
were being planned and debated. Marlow was well situated, with such
abundance of water and wood at its gates; and the question of
attracting desirable immigrants had been raised.</p>
<p>Time was afforded for the consideration of all these schemes by the
great frost which began on New Year&rsquo;s Day and lasted until the
end of February.</p>
<p>The frost came first from the south-west, and for three days the
country was changed into a fairy world built of sharp white crystals, a
world that was seen dimly through a magic veil of mist. Then followed a
black and bitter wind from the north-east, that bought a thin and
driving snow, and when the wind fell the country was locked in an iron
shell that was not relaxed for six weeks. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span></p>
<p>The flood had nearly subsided before the first frost came, but the
river was still high, and presently the water came down laden with
ice-floes, that jammed against the weir and the mill, and formed a
sheet of ice that gradually crept back towards the bridge.</p>
<p>All field and mill work was stopped, and Thrale and Eileen spent two
or three days a week making excursions to London, bringing back coal
and other forms of riches.</p>

<p class="first">Their fear of being misunderstood had proved to have
been an exaggeration. In that exalted mood of theirs, which had risen
to such heights, after four days of adventurous solitude, they had come
a little too near the stars. In finding themselves they had lost touch
with the world.</p>
<p>Elsie Durham had smiled at their defensive announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
touchy about it. I am so glad; and, of course, I&rsquo;ve known for
months that you would come to an understanding. And there&rsquo;s no
need to tell me that your&mdash;agreement, did you say?&mdash;was
entirely different to any other. I know. But be human about it.
Don&rsquo;t apologize for it by being superior to all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a dear,&rdquo; Eileen had said
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there were many women still left in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>Marlow who were less spiritually-minded than
Elsie Durham. Comparative idleness induced gossip, and there was more
than one party in the community which regarded Thrale and Eileen with
disfavour.</p>
<p>The old ruts had been worn too deep to be smoothed out in a few
months, however heavy had been the great roller of necessity. And,
strangely enough, the life of Sam Evans at High Wycombe was regarded by
many of the more bigoted with less displeasure than this perfectly
wholesome and desirable union of Thrale and Eileen. The prostitution of
Sam Evans was a new thing outside the experience of these women, and it
was accepted as an outcome of the new conditions. The other affair was
familiar in its associations, and was condemned on both the old and the
new precedents.</p>
<p>The mass of the women were quite unable to think out a new morality
for themselves&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Relief from all these foolish criticisms, gossipings
and false emotions came when the frost broke. A warm rain in the first
week of March released the soil from its bonds, and as the retarded
spring began to move impatiently into life there was a great call for
labour.</p>
<p>But as the year ripened the temperament of the community exhibited a
new and alarming symptom.</p>
<p>There was a terrible spirit of depression abroad.</p>
<p>All Nature was warm with the movement of reproduction. Nature was
growing and propagating, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>thrusting out and taking a larger
hold upon life. Nature was coming to the fight with new reserves and
allies, a fruitful and increasing army, eager for the struggle against
this little decreasing band of sterile humanity. Nature was prolific
and these women were barren.</p>
<p>And in some inexplicable way the consciousness of futility had
spread through the Marlow community. Some posthumous children had been
born since the plague, a few young girls&mdash;Millie among
them&mdash;were pregnant, but death had been busier than life during
the winter, and from outside came stray reports that in other
communities death had been busier still.</p>
<p>What hope was there for that generation? They were too few to cope
with their task. Grass was growing in their streets, their houses were
in need of repair, and after their day&rsquo;s labour in the fields to
provide themselves with food, they had neither strength nor inclination
to take up the battle anew.</p>
<p>Moreover, the spice was gone from life. Some inherent need for
emulation was gone. They were ceasing to take any pride in their
persons, and in their clothes. They wore knickerbockers or trousers for
convenience in working, and suffered a strange loss of self-esteem in
consequence. Many of the younger women still returned in the evenings
to what skirts and ribbons they still possessed, but the habit was
declining. The uselessness of it was growing even more apparent. There
were no sex distinctions or class distinctions among them. Of what
account was it that one girl was prettier or better <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>dressed than her neighbour? What mattered was
whether she was a stronger or more intelligent worker.</p>
<p>Above all, the woman&rsquo;s need for love and admiration could find
no outlet. They realized that they were becoming hardened and unsexed,
and revolted against the coming change. Something within them rose up
and cried for expression, and when it was thwarted it turned to a thing
of evil&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The mind of the community was becoming distorted. Hysteria, sexual
perversions, and various forms of religious mania were rife. Young
women broke into futile and unsatisfying orgies of foolish dancing, and
middle-aged women became absorbed in the contemplation of a male and
human god.</p>
<p>Even the committee did not escape the influence of the growing
despair. They looked forward to a future when such machines and tools
as they possessed would be worn out, and they had no means of replacing
them.</p>
<p>Thrale had reported that the line to London was becoming unsafe for
the passage of his trucks. Rust was at work upon the rails; rain and
floods had weakened embankments; young growths were springing up on the
permanent way, and it was hopeless to contemplate any work of repair.
In the old days an army of men had been needed for that work alone. The
country roads needed re-metalling, and the houses restoration; they had
not the means or the labour to undertake half the necessary work. There
were breaches in the river bank and a large and apparently permanent
lake was forming in the low <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href=
"#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>meadows towards Bourne End. All
about them Nature was so intensely busy in her own regardless way, and
they were helpless, now, to oppose her.</p>
<p>The age of iron and machinery was falling into a swift decline. All
that the community could look for in the future was a return to
primitive conditions and the fight for bare life. Every year their
tools and machines would grow less efficient, every year Nature would
return more powerful to the attack. In ten years they would be fighting
her with rude and tedious weapons of wood, grinding their scanty corn
between two stones, and living from hand to mouth. In the bountiful
South such a life might have its rewards, but how could they endure it
in this uncertain and cruel North?</p>
<p>So while the sun rose higher in the sky and the earth was
wonderfully reclothed, the women of Marlow fell deeper and deeper into
the horrors of mental depression. What had they to work for, and to
hope for, save this miserable possession of unsatisfied life?

<p class="first">One bright morning, at the end of April, Jasper and
Eileen sat on the cliffs at the Land&rsquo;s End and talked of the
future.</p>
<p>Ten days before, they had left Marlow on bicycles to make
exploration. They intended to return; they had explained they would be
away for a month at the outside, but in view of the growing depression
and the loss of spirit shown by the community, they considered it
necessary to go out and discover what conditions obtained in other
parts of England. It might be, they urged, that the plague had been
less deadly in other districts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should not know, here,&rdquo; Jasper had argued.
&ldquo;There may be many men left elsewhere; but they might not have
been able to communicate with us yet. Their attention, like ours, would
have been concentrated upon local conditions for a time. Eileen and I
will find out. Perhaps we may be able to open up communication again.
In any case we&rsquo;ll come back within a month and report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His natural instinct had taken him into the West Country.</p>
<p>They had left Elsie Durham slightly more cheerful. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>They
had given her a gleam of hope, given her something, at last, to which
she might look forward.</p>
<p>Their own hopes had quickly faded and died as they rode on into the
West. By the time they reached Plymouth they were thinking of Marlow as
a place peculiarly favoured by Providence.</p>
<p>At first they had passed through communities conducted on lines
resembling their own, greater or smaller groups of women working more
or less in co-operation. In many of these communities a single man was
living&mdash;in some cases two men&mdash;who viewed their duty towards
society in the same light as the Adonis of Wycombe.</p>
<p>But the unit grew steadily smaller as they progressed. It was no
longer the town or village community but the farm which was the centre
of activity, and the occupied farms grew more scattered. For it
appeared that here in the West the plague had attacked women as well as
men. Another curious fact they learned was that the men had taken
longer to die. One woman spoke of having nursed her husband for two
months before the paralysis proved fatal&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And if the depression in Marlow had been great, the travellers soon
learned that elsewhere it was greater still. The women worked
mechanically, drudgingly. They spoke in low, melancholy voices when
they were questioned, and save for a faint accession of interest in
Thrale&rsquo;s presence there, and the signs of some feeble flicker of
hope as they asked of conditions further north and east, they appeared
to have no thought beyond the instant necessity of sustaining the life
to which they clung so feebly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306"
href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>Thrale and Eileen rode on
into Cornwall, not because they still hoped, but because they both felt
a vivid desire to reach the Land&rsquo;s End and gaze out over the
Atlantic. They wanted to leave this desolate land behind them for a few
hours, and rest their minds in the presence of the unchangeable
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go on and forget for a few days,&rdquo; Eileen had
said, and so they had at last reached the furthest limit of land.</p>
<p>Cornwall had proved to be a land of the dead. Save for a few women
in the neighbourhood of St Austell, they had not seen a living human
being in the whole county.</p>
<p>And so, on this clear April morning, they sat upon this ultimate
cliff and talked of the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The water below them was delicately flecked with
white. No long rollers were riding in from the Atlantic, but the fresh
April breeze was flicking the crests of little waves into foam; and,
above, an ever-renewed drift of scattered white clouds threw coursing
shadows upon the blues and purples of the curdling sea.</p>
<p>Eileen and Thrale had walked southwards as far as Carn Voel to avoid
the obstruction to vision of the Longships, and on three sides they
looked out to an unbroken horizon of water, which on that bright
morning was clearly differentiated from the impending sky. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;One might forget&mdash;here,&rdquo; remarked Eileen, after a
long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were better to forget,&rdquo; said Jasper.</p>
<p>Eileen drew up her knees until she could rest her chin upon them,
embracing them with her arms. &ldquo;What can one do?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;What good is it all, if there is no future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to live out one&rsquo;s own life in the best way,&rdquo;
was the answer.</p>
<p>She frowned over that for a time. &ldquo;Do you really believe,
dear,&rdquo; she said, when she had considered Jasper&rsquo;s
suggestion, &ldquo;do you really believe that this is the end of
humanity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have changed my
mind half a dozen times in the last few days. There may be a race
untouched somewhere&mdash;in the archipelagos of the South Seas,
perhaps&mdash;which will gradually develop and repeople the world
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in Australia, or New Zealand,&rdquo; she prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have heard from them before this,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We must have heard before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is there no hope for us, here in England, in Marlow?
There are a few boys&mdash;infants born since the plague, you
know&mdash;and there will be more children in the
future&mdash;Evans&rsquo;s children and those others. There were two
men in some places, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they ever grow up? It seems to me that the women are
dying. They&rsquo;ve nothing to live for. It&rsquo;s only a year since
the plague first came, and look at them now. What will they be like in
five years&rsquo; time? They&rsquo;ll die of hopelessness, or commit
suicide, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>simply starve from the lack of any purpose in
living, because work isn&rsquo;t worth while. And the others, the
mothers, that have some object in living, will fall back into savagery.
They&rsquo;ll be so occupied in the necessity for work, for forcing a
living out of the ground somehow, that they&rsquo;ll have neither time
nor wish to teach their children. I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems to
me that we are faced with decrease, gradually leading on to
extinction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I doubt,&rdquo; he continued, after a little hesitation,
&ldquo;I doubt whether these sons of the new conditions will have much
vitality. They are the children of lust on the father&rsquo;s side,
worse still, of tired lust. It does make a difference. Perhaps if we
were a young and vigorous people like the old Jews the seed would be
strong enough to override any inherent weakness. But we are not, we are
an old civilization. Before the plague, we had come to a consideration
of eugenics. It had been forced upon us. A vital and growing people
does not spend its time on such a question as that. Eugenics was a
proposition that grew out of the necessity of the time. It was easy
enough to deny decadence, and to prove our fitness by apparently sound
argument, but, to me, it always seemed that this growing demand for
some form of artificial selection of parents, by restriction of the
palpably unfit, afforded the surest evidence. Things like that are only
produced if there is a need for them. Eugenics was a
symptom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eileen sighed. &ldquo;And what about us?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; replied Jasper. &ldquo;Probably the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>happiest people in the world at the present
time. And we must try to give some of our happiness to others. We must
go back to Marlow and work for the community. And I think we&rsquo;ll
try in our limited way to do something for the younger generation.
Perhaps, it might be possible for us to go north and try our hands at
making steel, there are probably women there who would help us. But I
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth while, unless to preserve our
knowledge and hand it on. We can only lessen the difficulty in one
little district for a time. As the pressure of necessity grows, as it
must grow, we shall be forced to abandon manufacture. The need for food
will outrun us. We are too few, and it will be simpler and perhaps
quicker to plough with a wooden plough than to wait for our faulty and
slowly-produced steel. The adult population, small as it is, must
decrease, and I&rsquo;m afraid it will decrease more rapidly than we
anticipate, owing to these causes of depression and lack of
stimulus&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Eileen at last, getting to her feet,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re happy, as you say, and our job seems pretty plain
before us. To-morrow, I suppose, we ought to be getting back, though I
hate taking the news to Elsie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper came and stood beside her, and put his arm across her
shoulders. &ldquo;We, at any rate, must keep our spirits up,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;That, before everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Eileen, brightly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you and, for the moment, the sea. We&rsquo;ll
come back here sometimes, if the roads don&rsquo;t get too bad.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if the roads don&rsquo;t get too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, already, the briars are creeping across the road from
hedge to hedge. The forest is coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The forest and the wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her a little closer and they stood looking out towards the
horizon.</p>

<p class="first">In the south-west the clear line had been wiped out
and what looked like mist was sweeping towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a shower coming,&rdquo; said Thrale.</p>
<p>They stood quietly and let the sharp spatter of rain beat in their
faces, and then the shadow of the storm moved on and the horizon line
was clear again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer cloud out there,&rdquo; said Eileen.
&ldquo;Is it another shower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to a tiny blur on the far rim of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> queer,&rdquo; said Thrale. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so
precisely like the smoke of a steamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few seconds they gazed in intent silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting bigger,&rdquo; broke out Eileen, suddenly
excited. &ldquo;What is it, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; he
said. He moved away from her and shaded his eyes from the glare of the
momentarily cloudless sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; he repeated
mechanically.</p>
<p>The blur was widening into a grey-black smudge, into a vaguely
diffused smear with a darker centre. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;With the wind blowing towards us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said
Jasper, and broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;what?&rdquo; asked Eileen, and then as he did
not answer, she gripped his arm and repeated importunately.
&ldquo;What? Jasper, what? With the wind blowing towards us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God it is,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, disregarding her
question. &ldquo;By God it <i>is</i>,&rdquo; he repeated, and then a
third time, &ldquo;It <i>is</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what, what? Do answer me! I can&rsquo;t see!&rdquo;
pleaded Eileen.</p>
<p>But still he did not answer. He stood like a rock and stared without
wavering at the growing cloud on the horizon.</p>
<p>And then the cloud began to grow more diffused, to die away, and
Eileen could see tiny indentations on the sky line, indentations which
pushed up and presently revealed themselves as attached to a little
black speck in the remotest distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jasper!&rdquo; she cried, and her eyes filled with
inexplicable tears, so that she could see only a misty field of
troubled blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a liner,&rdquo; said Jasper at last, turning to
her. He looked puzzled and his eyes stared through her. &ldquo;And its
coming from America. Do you suppose the American
women&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat was revealed now. They could see the shape of her, the high
deck, the two tall funnels and the three masts. She was passing across,
fifteen miles or so to the south of them, making up Channel.</p>
<p>For a moment they felt like shipwrecked sailors on a lonely island,
who see a vessel pass beyond hail. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312"
href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jasper, what can it be?&rdquo; Eileen besought him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a White Star boat,&rdquo; he said, and he still
spoke as if his mind was far away. &ldquo;Is it possible, is it anyway
possible that America has survived? Is it possible that there is
traffic between America and Europe, and that they pass us by for fear
of infection? How do we know that vessels haven&rsquo;t been passing up
the Channel for months past? Why should we think that this is the
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> the first,&rdquo; proclaimed Eileen. &ldquo;I
feel it. Oh, let us hurry. Let us ride and ride as fast as we can to
Plymouth or Southampton. I know they&rsquo;ll be coming to Plymouth or
Southampton. Men, Jasper, men! No women would dare to run a boat at
that pace. See how fast she is going. Oh hurry, hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught fire then. They ran back to find their bicycles. They ran,
and presently they rode in silence, with fierce intensity. They rode at
first as if they had but ten miles to go, and the lives of all the
women in England depended upon their speed.</p>
<p>And though they slackened after the first few miles they still rode
on with such eager determination that they reached Plymouth at
sunset.</p>
<p>But they could see no sign of the liner in the waters about
Plymouth. They saw only the deserted hulks of a hundred vessels that
had ridden there untouched for twelve months, futile battleships and
destroyers among them; great, venomous, useless things that had become
void of all meaning in the struggle of humanity. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not here. Let&rsquo;s go on!&rdquo; said
Eileen.</p>
<p>Jasper shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well over a hundred
miles to Southampton,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nearer a hundred and
fifty, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must go on, we must,&rdquo; urged Eileen.</p>
<p>It was evident that Jasper, too, felt a compelling desire to go on.
He stood still with a look of intense concentration on his face. Eileen
had seen him look thus, when he had been momentarily frustrated by some
problem of mill machinery. She waited expectant for the solution she
was sure would presently emerge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motor,&rdquo; he said, speaking in short disconnected
sentences. &ldquo;If we can find paraffin and petrol and
candles&mdash;light of some sort. The engines wouldn&rsquo;t rust, but
they&rsquo;d clog. It must be paraffin. We daren&rsquo;t clean with
petrol by artificial light. It&rsquo;s possible. Let&rsquo;s
try&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Jasper did not sleep, but Eileen, as she sat beside him
in the softly moving motor, soon lost consciousness of the dim streak
of road and black river of hedge. The moon, in her third quarter, had
risen before midnight, and when they started was riding deep in the
sky, half veiled by a vast wing of dappled cirrus. And that, too,
merged into her dream. She thought she was driving out into the open
sea in a ship which became miraculously winged and soared up towards an
ever-approaching but unincreasing moon. She woke with a start to find
that it was broad daylight and that a thin misty rain was coming up
from the sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Solent,&rdquo; said Jasper, pointing to a distant gleam
below them.</p>
<p>On the common they stopped and stood up in the car, watching a
distant smear of smoke that stained the thin mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be coming up Southampton Water with the lead
going,&rdquo; said Jasper, trying desperately to be calm. <span class=

<h2 class="super">EPILOGUE</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE GREAT PLAN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the evening of that day Jasper and Eileen dined on
board the &ldquo;Bombastic,&rdquo; that latest development of the old
trans-Atlantic competition in shipbuilding, the boat that had made her
first journey to New York carrying fugitives from England in the days
when the threat of the plague grew hourly more imminent. The
&ldquo;Bombastic&rdquo; had not justified her name, she had fled from
Southampton without ceremony, and she had not returned for over a year.
The &ldquo;Apologetic&rdquo; would have been more apt.</p>
<p>And on this evening of her return, the demeanour of that crowd of
quiet serious men in the huge over-decorated saloon, gave no hint of
bombast. As they listened intently to the rapid story of their two
travel-stained and somewhat ragged guests, there was no hint of brag or
boast among them all. They came not as conquerors but as friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But oh, it&rsquo;s <i>your</i> story we want to hear,&rdquo;
broke in Eileen at last.</p>
<p>She had been strangely quiet so far, she had become suddenly
conscious of the defects of her dress. The old associations were
swarming about her. Eighteen months ago she had sat in just such
another saloon as this, courted and flattered, the daughter
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>of a great aristocrat, a creature on a remote
and gorgeous pedestal. Now it seemed that she was neither greater nor
less than any man present. She was one of them, not set apart. She
looked down at her hands, still oil-stained by her struggles with the
motor on the previous night.</p>
<p>Jasper had been more patient. He was not less eager than Eileen to
hear the explanation of this wonderful visit, of the resurrection of
these twelve hundred men from a dead and silent world. But he had
restrained his impatience and told his story first. He knew that so he
would be more quickly satisfied. He would be able to listen to men who
were not tense with an anxiety to ask questions.</p>
<p>They were sitting now at one end of a long table in the saloon,
after eating a meal that had provided once more the longed-for
satisfaction of salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said an American at the head of the table,
turning to Eileen in answer to her protest, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve maybe
been selfish in putting all these questions but we&rsquo;re looking
ahead. We aren&rsquo;t forgetting that we&rsquo;ve a big work to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get here?&rdquo; asked Eileen impetuously.
&ldquo;How is it that you&rsquo;re all alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as to that, you&rsquo;d better ask the doctor,
there,&rdquo; replied the American. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a countryman of
yours, and he&rsquo;s been in the thick of it and knows the life story
of that plague microbe like the history of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor, a bearded, grave-eyed man, looked up and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We shall never know
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>now, I hope, the history of the plague organism.
It was never studied under the microscope&mdash;we were too
busy&mdash;and now we trust that the bacillus&mdash;if it were a
bacillus&mdash;has encompassed its own destruction. What interests you,
however, is that this sudden, miraculously sudden, development of its
deadly power as regards humanity ran through a determinable cycle of
evolution. From what you&rsquo;ve told us, already, it seems clear, I
think, that even in England the bacillus was losing what I may call its
effectiveness. The men in the West Country you&rsquo;ve described,
probably died from starvation and neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment and then continued: &ldquo;Now in America
both men and women were attacked. There was certainly a greater
percentage of male cases, but I suppose something like half the female
population was infected as well. As far as one can judge the bacillus
was simply losing power. But for all we know it may have developed, it
may be entering on a new stage of evolution, and in some apparently
haphazard way now be beneficial to man instead of deadly. Such things
may be happening every day below the reach of our knowledge. The little
world is hidden from us, even as the great world is
hidden&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he went on more briskly, &ldquo;the thing we
do know is that the symptoms of the new plague in America differed
materially from our expectation of them, gathered from the accounts
that had reached us from the Old World. In England the paralysis
lasted, I believe, some forty-eight hours and ended in death. In
America the paralysis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href=
"#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>rarely ended fatally, but it
lasted in some cases for six months. &lsquo;Paresis,&rsquo; we called
it. The patient was perfectly conscious but practically unable to move
hand or foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That paresis gave us time to do some very clear and
consecutive thinking, I may remark,&rdquo; put in an American. &ldquo;I
had four months to study my ideas of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;America is no less changed
than England,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it is another change. Well,
you understand that we did not all get the plague over there; the thing
was less deadly in attack and about ten per cent of us were left to
look after the patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And find food,&rdquo; interpolated one of the listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a time we won&rsquo;t ever forget,&rdquo; agreed
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; said some one, and a general murmur of
assent ran round the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the machines were idle, of course,&rdquo; continued
the doctor, &ldquo;and even when the tide of recovery began to flow we
had to turn our attention first to the getting of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that we&rsquo;d have been here
before this,&rdquo; said a young man. &ldquo;I feel we owe England and
Europe some kind of an apology, but we just had to get busy on food
growing right away. We couldn&rsquo;t spare a ship&rsquo;s crew till
three weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the others are hard at it over there still,&rdquo; put in
another. &ldquo;This is just a pioneer party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so comprehensible now,&rdquo; said Thrale
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>after a silence, &ldquo;but we had no idea, we
never thought there could be any one living in America. We thought that
somehow we must have heard. One forgets&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried to get on to you,&rdquo; said one of the party,
&ldquo;by cable and wireless. We kept on tapping away for months, but
we got no reply. We thought you must be all dead too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we guessed you were having a real bad time
anyway,&rdquo; amended another. &ldquo;You see we knew the way that
plague had taken Europe but we kept hoping and trying to get on to you
all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a message for Elsie, after all,&rdquo; Eileen
said to Jasper the next day. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s hope for us
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s hope,&rdquo; said Jasper.</p>
<p>They had been up at the town railway station assisting a party of
Americans to investigate the condition of the rolling stock and the
permanent way. Neither could be pronounced satisfactory. A few women
had come in from the neighbouring country that morning attracted by the
sight of an inexplicable pillar of smoke, and their report of local
conditions had been equally uninspiring. They had spoken of famine and
failure, but their faces had been lit by a new brightness at the sight
of this miraculous little army of men. There had been hope in the faces
and bearing of these toil-worn women, faith in the promise of support
and succour.</p>
<p>Now Jasper and Eileen stood looking down towards the harbour. The
tide was creeping in to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href=
"#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>efface the repulsive ugliness of
the mud flats, and the sluggish water rippled faintly against the foul
sloping sides of small boats that had lain anchored there for more than
twelve months. Behind them, across the line, was a row of unsightly
houses, hung with weather-slating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s hope,&rdquo; repeated Jasper.</p>
<p>He was thinking of all the work that lay before them, and yet he had
faith that a new and better civilization would arise. &ldquo;We must
get things going again,&rdquo; had been the Americans&rsquo; phrase,
and they apparently faced the future without a qualm.</p>
<p>But Jasper&rsquo;s mind was perplexed with the detail of the
mechanical work that must be faced, detail so intricate and confused
that he was bewildered by its complexity. It appeared to him that the
crux of the whole problem lay in the North, in the counties of coal and
iron. Coal and steel were the first essentials, he thought. They must
begin there in however small a way, and America must send out more men,
continually more men. To-morrow he was going back in the motor, with
two experts, to the cable hut in Sennen Cove. They were going to test
the cable and hoped to re-establish communication with America, and
then more ships would come and more men, ever more men.</p>
<p>And, even so, they could do little at first, and beyond lay the
whole of Europe and still further the whole of Asia. Were women there,
also, maintaining the terrible fight against Nature in the awful
struggle to find food? Steel and coal we must have, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>was
the burden of his thought, and in his imagination he pictured the
waking of factories and mines, he had a vision of little engines
running&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Eileen&rsquo;s thought had flown ahead. With one magnificent leap
she had passed from the contemplation of present necessity to a
realization of the dim future. And <i>her</i> thought found words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope, lots of hope,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hope of a new
clean world. We&rsquo;ve got such a chance to begin all over again, and
do it better. No more sweated labour, Jasper, and no more living on the
work of others. We&rsquo;ve just got to pull together and work for each
other. If we can get enough food, and we can now with all these dear
men come to help us, we can do such wonderful things afterwards.
There&rsquo;ll be lots of children growing up in a few years&rsquo;
time, and we shall teach them the things we&rsquo;ve had to learn by
the force of necessity. They&rsquo;ll begin so differently because,
although we have had the experience of all history, we
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be bound by all the foolish conventions that grew
out of it. Such a silly incongruous growth, wasn&rsquo;t it? But I
suppose it couldn&rsquo;t be helped in one way. We were so penned in.
We all had our rotten little places to keep and that took all our time.
We never had a chance to consider the broad issues, the real
fundamental things. But you&rsquo;ve got to consider the fundamental
things when you start clean away from a new beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, oh! Jasper, surely we have all learnt certain things to
avoid, haven&rsquo;t we? I mean class distinctions and sex
distinctions, and things like that. Women won&rsquo;t trouble any more
about titles and all that rot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324"
href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>now, and anyway there
aren&rsquo;t any left to trouble about. And social conditions will be
so different now that there won&rsquo;t be any more marriage. Marriage
was a man&rsquo;s prerogative; he wanted to keep his woman to himself,
and keep his property for his children. It never really protected
women, and anyway they were capable of protecting themselves if
they&rsquo;d been given a chance. I know the children were a difficulty
in the old days, but they won&rsquo;t be now. It&rsquo;ll be
everybody&rsquo;s business to see that the children get looked after,
and a woman won&rsquo;t starve just because she hasn&rsquo;t got a
husband to keep her. She&rsquo;ll get better wages than that. The women
who have children will be the most precious things we shall have.
They&rsquo;ll live healthier lives, too, and they won&rsquo;t be
incapacitated as they used to be. They&rsquo;ll work and be strong
instead of spending all their time either in doing nothing or pottering
about the house in an eternal round of cleaning the stupid, ugly things
we used. We shall have to have all new houses, Jasper, when we get
things going again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it <i>will</i> be splendid,&rdquo; she broke out in a
great burst of enthusiasm, &ldquo;and we begin to-day. We have
begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful opportunity,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, wonderful,&rdquo; repeated Eileen. &ldquo;We all,
men and women, start level again. Equality, Jasper, It&rsquo;s a
beautiful word&mdash;Equality. Of course I know how unequal we all are
from one point of view, and there must come a sort of aristocracy of
intellect and efficiency. But underneath there will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>be a
true equality for all that, and we shall see to it that no man or woman
can abuse their powers by making slaves again. What a world of slaves
it used to be, and we weren&rsquo;t even slaves to intellect and
efficiency, only to wealth and to money, and to some foolish idea of
position and power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got <i>our</i> work to do, here and
now,&rdquo; said Jasper after a long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work? Of course, and I love it,&rdquo; returned Eileen,
&ldquo;and while we work we&rsquo;ve got to think and teach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tide was coming in steadily, and near them an old boat that had
been lying on the mud was now afloat once more and had taken on some of
its old dignity.</p>
<p>Eileen pointed to it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re afloat again,&rdquo; she
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Embarked on the greatest plan the world has ever
known,&rdquo; added Jasper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all part of the great plan,&rdquo; concluded
Eileen.</p>

<p class="adByline">by ALFRED TENNYSON <span class=

<p class="adReview">&ldquo;With considerable skill we are shown how
ignorant and conventional prejudice of all the normal inhabitants of
the village are roused against the poor, good giant, only because he is
greater than they are. Mr. Tennyson gives a vivid and unpleasant
picture of prejudice and instinctive cruelty. In Mr. Tennyson we have a
new novelist with something real and weighty to
say.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette</i>.</p>

<p class="adReview">&ldquo;When one has once opened &lsquo;The Marriage

Cutcliffe Hyne has such a vivid pen and seems so intimately acquainted
with the sea and seafaring life, and introduces us to so many humorous
and realistic characters, that we feel as if we had actually sailed
with the great Kettle on his adventurous voyages, and had shared his
hairbreadth escapes.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Evening Standard and St.

London as a welcome relief from the dulness of most contemporary
fiction, and his latest, &lsquo;Burning Daylight,&rsquo; did not
disappoint me in this respect. No one who has read the author&rsquo;s
previous works will need to be told with what wonderful skill the
atmosphere of this grim and unfriendly land is conveyed. There is one
chapter, especially, which tells how, for a bet, Daylight raced two
thousand miles over an unbroken trail of ice in sixty days that seems
to me absolutely the best piece of descriptive writing of its kind that
ever I read.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>Illustrated by CLARA WATERS.</p>
<p class="adReview">A brightly coloured story, the scene of which is
laid in Barcelona. A young Irish girl who is dependent on herself for a
means of subsistence becomes a &ldquo;star&rdquo; turn at a circus.
While in the back-waters of that existence she falls in with certain
gentlemen of international importance. She becomes their dupe and slave
and passes through many adventures. But there is a way of escape and
she takes it. Decidedly a book of swift movement and keen excitement.
